*(Requires Attunement)* Your unaramed attacks ignore resistance. In addition, the `Tenderized` efffect now stacks up to 4 times. A creature with 4 stacks of `Tenderized` becomes `Fully Tender`, at which point the bonus damage on further attacks is increased to +2 and the number required to crit is 19.

For each additional 4 stacks beyond 8, the bonus damage is increased by 1 and the number required to crit is decreased by 1 (minimum 2).
