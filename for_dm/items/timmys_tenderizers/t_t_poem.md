Poem describing Timmy's Tenderizer's found in Archive of Auxillary Attunement:

> If worn without attunementâ€™s touch,
The Tenderizer's weight will clutch,
Their mass will rise with every blow,
The burden rises, slow but sure.
>
> At first, your strikes will lose their aim,
> And then your movement starts to fade.
> Each step a struggle in the fight,
> With memories that have a bite.
>
>  To learn to punch without such straining,
Takes preparation, time for training.
First, don the Trainers, worn with care,
They're stored with other items rare.
>
> When worn at night and worn in day,
> Become accustomed to their weight.
> Then face their their owner, brave and bold,
> With only fists, your skills unfold.
>
>  There's still more power to be won,
> A feast prepared by his grandson.
> A place where meat is always tender,
> And fighters fight but don't surrender.
>
> It's there your final training waits,
> Both victory and brisket taste.
> Your fists will fly in a barrage,
> Just like a Rocky-esque montage.
