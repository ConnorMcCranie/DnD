A sleek, silvery crossbow which is so smooth and glossy that it seems to be made of liquid metal, though it is cool to the touch and holds its shape like a solid.
:

*(Arcane Ammunition)* The magic imbued in this crossbow gives it the power to generate it's own unique ammunition, seemingly from thin air. You have 2 charges of `Arcane Ammunition`, which replenish on a long rest. When making an attack with the Cunning Crossbow, you may spend 1 charge of `Arcane Ammunition` to shoot one of the following arrows.
\column
:
 None of these arrows inflict damage to their target, and their effect disappears after 1 hour or if another charge of `Arcance Ammunition` is used.
:
- `Rope arrow`: A length of up to 80ft of rope is created from the tail of of this arrow as it flies. On a hit, the rope becomes magically fastened to its target. 
- `Tracking Arrow`: On a hit, this arrow begins tracking its target. The arrow then disappears and the target must make a DC 12 Wisdom save or else fail to notice being hit. You can use your bonus action to learn their current location, but doing so ends the arrow's effect. 
- `Spying Arrow`: Wherever it lands, this invisible arrow starts taking in its surroundings, and you can use your bonus action to see as if you were at the arrow's location. You may return to seeing normally at will, but doing so makes the arrow disappear. 
- `Illuminating Arrow`: Wherever this arrow lands, it magically transforms into a radiating ball of light, which sheds dim light in a 10 ft radius. You can use your bonus action to move the light up to 60 ft.

*(Attunement)* You sense that there is yet more magic instilled in this item, but you're not quite sure how to access it.
