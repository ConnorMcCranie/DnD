Her memory you must not weep.
There lies the contract’s secret power,
Atop the highest, darkest tower.

### Auxiliary Attunement
- To achieve the maximum level of attunement with the ocarina, You must find the fairy Kaysa near the Gallant Grasslands
- She will add more songs to the songbook in exchange for restoring harmony to the Enchanted Grove, a sacred forest plagued by discord.
  
From chatgpt  (probably needs tuning):
Objective: To learn the ancient songs of the fairy, you must 

Background: The Enchanted Grove was once a place of serene beauty and magical harmony, where fairy songs thrived. But recently, the grove has fallen into disarray. The ancient fairy's songs have been lost to the winds, and the once-vibrant forest is now overshadowed by chaos.

Steps:

1. Find the Grove: Venture to the Enchanted Grove, a mystical forest known for its lush beauty and magical creatures. The grove lies beyond the Misty Glade, where the air shimmers with enchantment.

2. Gather the Fractured Echoes: Scattered throughout the grove are fragments of the fairy's lost songs. These echoes have taken physical form as enchanted crystals. Collect these crystals, which resonate with the lost melodies of the grove.

3. Calm the Troubled Spirits: The grove is plagued by restless spirits who disrupt the natural balance. Use your skills to calm these spirits through acts of compassion and understanding. This will help restore some of the grove’s natural harmony.

4. Restore the Song Trees: In the heart of the grove stand ancient Song Trees, whose magical melodies have been silenced. Using the collected echoes, perform a ritual at each tree to restore its voice. This ritual involves aligning the echoes in a specific pattern and playing a simple tune to awaken the tree’s magic.

5. Confront the Source of Discord: Deep within the grove lies a corrupted spirit that has been feeding off the grove’s discord. Defeat or placate this spirit to remove its influence from the forest. This task may involve a challenge of wit or combat, depending on the spirit’s nature.

6. Learn the Fairy’s Songs: With the grove restored and harmony reestablished, the ancient fairy will reveal herself. As a reward, she will teach you her songs. These melodies are not just music but are imbued with powerful magic that connects you to the natural world.
  
**clue for players:** 
> To reach the ocarina’s height,
Seek Kaysa where the grasslands light.
And in the gallant wide embrace,
You'll find the fairy’s gentle grace.
>
>To gain the deepest bond of all,
Restore the grove where shadows fall.
Where once enchanted, pure and bright,
Now suffers from the discord’s blight.
