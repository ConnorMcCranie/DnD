Poem describing Opalescent Ocarina found in Archive of Auxiliary Attunement:

> In a world where magic flows,
>
> And opalescent light bestows.
>
> A melody, so rare and true,
>
> The song you play which then plays you.
>
> If used without the charm’s embrace,
> 
> Then Chaos might just find its place.
>
> Wild magic’s surge, what does it do?
>
> A blessing, curse, or both ensue.
>
>&nbsp;
>
> To navigate the tides of madness,
> 
> You first must study verse and chorus.
> 
> A fairy's songbook old and rumored
> 
> Holds secrets whispered, seldom humored.
>
> Within its pages, truth is spun,
> 
> A melody for all to come.
> 
> With Kaysa's guidance, chaos yields,
> 
> What once was hidden, now revealed.
>
>&nbsp;
>
> To reach the ocarina’s height,
> 
> Seek Kaysa, grasslands' ancient sprite.
> 
> And in the gallant wide embrace,
>
> You'll find the fairy’s gentle grace.
>
> To gain the deepest bond of all,
>
> Restore the grove where shadows fall.
>
> Where once enchanted, pure and bright,
>
> Now suffers from the discord’s blight.
