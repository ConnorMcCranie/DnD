Poem describing Corvine Corset found in Archive of Auxiliary Attunement:

> In realms where magic weaves its strand,
> 
> A corset binds both tight and grand.
> 
> If change you seek without attuning,
> 
> It clasps you fast, slim chance removing.
>
> At midnight’s toll, a test unfolds,
> 
> A trial of wisdom, fate beholds.
>
> If failed, you’ll shift and take the wing,
>
> While raven’s antics you’ll now bring.
>
>&nbsp;
>
> Attunement, you must now take heed,
>
> An altar made from Midnight’s wing.
>
> The Raven Queen's most precious feather,
>
> Will bind your fate with magic’s tether.
>
>&nbsp;
>
> To gain the most from corset's grace,
>
> You'll sign the contract, find your place.
>
> A quill from Raven’s feather made,
>
> Ensures your magic’s never swayed.
>
> In Shadowfell, a fortress deep,
>
> Her memory you must not weep.
>
> There lies the contract’s secret power,
>
> Atop the highest, darkest tower.
