Poem describing Pirouetter's Pointe Shoes found in Archive of Auxiliary Attunement:
> In magic shoes of dancing grace,
>
> A wondrous charm you may embrace.
>
> But heed the tale of caution true,
>
> Attunement's needed through and through.
>
> Without the bond, these shoes take flight,
>
> They yearn to be in the spotlight .
>
> With poise, they'll jump and twirl and spin,
>
> Regardless of the feet within.
>
>&nbsp;
>
> Attuning to the magic shoes,
>
> The proper form you'll have to use.
>
> The right technique is quite elusive
>
> A certain source would be condusive.
>
> A gnome whose name does start with "D",
> 
> His diary must hold the key.
> 
> He learned that dance is naught but fighting,
> 
> While putting all his thoughts to writing.
>
>&nbsp;
>
> To reach the height of dancing power,
>
> A certain school you'll have to scour.
>
> That's where a gnome displays his art,
>
> Where dance and fighting both impart.
> 
> They'll say, "The lesson's free, of course!"
> 
> But best beware pervasive force.
> 
> Unless you'd like to stay there longer,
> 
> Then pray your power o' will is stronger.
