### Pirouetter's Pointe Shoes
*Clothing, Artifact*
:
A pair of ballerina's shoes which give the wearer dancing ability beyond what is considered reasonably possible.
:
You gain +1 Acrobatics and +1 Performance whenever you are unarmed or wielding `Dance Weapons` (*Whip, Baton, Ribbon, Pom-Pom, Hula Hoop, Poi*).
:
*(Requires Attunement)* `Dance Fighting`: Whenever you make an `Unarmed Strike` or an attack with a `Dance Weapon`, you may add Acrobatics to your attack roll (instead of Str/Dex+Proficiency). When rolling for damage, you may add Performance (instead of Str/Dex).
:
*(Requires Auxillary Attunement)* `Dance-Off`: Once per long rest, you may challenge a creature to a `Dance-Off`, whereupon they must succeed a DC 6+Acro+Perf Charisma saving throw or else be teleported to the `Dance Dimension` with you. In the `Dance Dimension` you gain `Impeccable Rhythm`: +2 Acro, +2 Perf and immunity to conditions which restain movement (paralyzed, stunned, etc.). You also get to pick the song. If either you or the creature reaches 0 HP (or at will), you are both teleported back to wherever you originally challenged the `Dance-Off`.
