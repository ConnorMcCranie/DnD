A pair of ballerina's shoes which give the wearer dancing ability beyond what is considered reasonably possible. Originally crafted by a gnomish dancer, they now seem to have a mind of their own. The wearer must frequently dance whether they want to or not. 
:
You gain +1 Acrobatics and +1 Performance whenever you are unarmed or wielding `Dance Weapons` (*Whip, Baton, Ribbon, Pom-Pom, Hula Hoop, Poi*).

*(Requires Attunement)* `Dance Fighting`: Whenever you make an `Unarmed Strike` or an attack with a `Dance Weapon`, you may add Acrobatics to your attack roll (instead of Str/Dex+Proficiency). When rolling for damage, you may add Performance (instead of Str/Dex).

:
*(Requires Auxiliary Attunement)* There is more dancing prowess imbued within these magical shoes than meets the eye. To master the shoes' full potential, you'll need to study dance-fighting techniques from their creator.

*(Requires Auxiliary Attunement)* `Dance-Off`: Once per long rest, you may challenge a creature to a `Dance-Off`, whereupon they must succeed a DC 6+Acro+Perf Charisma saving throw or else be teleported to the `Dance Dimension` with you. In the `Dance Dimension` you gain `Impeccable Rhythm`: +2 Acro, +2 Perf and immunity to conditions which restain movement (paralyzed, stunned, etc.). You also get to pick the song. If either you or the creature reaches 0 HP (or at will), you are both teleported back to wherever you originally challenged the `Dance-Off`.
