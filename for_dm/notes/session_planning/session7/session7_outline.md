# Session 7 Outline

### Main ideas:
- Nibbles tells about the Secret Society of Super Squirrels and how he enchanted the shoes
- Alyona communicates telepathically "WTF HAPPENED?"
- Nibbles teleports party to a place of their choosing

### More detailed
- Nibbles
  - tells full title (since Kebo-wan asked)
    > Full title is: Squeakian Thistlewood Acornspark Cleverwhisker XLII, Grand Magister of the Verdant Glade and Arborial Sanctum, Archmage of the Celestial Nutwood Conclave, Sovereign Protector of the Enchanted Oaklands, Keeper of the Ancient Acorn Mysteries, and High Sage of the Society of Super Squirrels, but you can just call me "Nibbles." 
  - tells about SSSS
  > "When I was younger, I practiced my enchantments without any regard for the consequences. Those shoes there are one example: I knew that they would be able to hold a powerful enchantment because of Derek's immense passion for dance fighting. You see, powerful magic can be extremely chaotic, but this chaos can be tethered by powerful emotions. Without the right emotions and experiences to ground them in reality, potent enchantments can make the user do things they wouldn't normally do. This chaos can vary in strength, ranging from relatively mild consequences to (such as dancing against your will or glowing inexplicably) to dire consequences (such as losing one's mind entirely)." 

  > "That's why I said I feel party responsible for tonight's events. I sensed that the shoes' enchantment had suddenly activated, and upon locating them I saw that you had been taken to that vault against your will. I'm sure you fine traveler's wouldn't have broken into a museum's vault and stolen precious artifacts if it hadn't been for those shoes putting you in that situation, right?"

  > "Anyways, as a grew older, I realized that the consequences of my enchantments could be much worse than I originally thought, even if at first they were relatively minor. That's why I joined the Secret Society of Super Squirrels. We are a group of supremely powerful squirrels whose mission is to maintain balance in the realm while staying completely neutral and only getting involved if absolutely necessar--"
    
    At this point, Nibbles realizes that he has just got involved by teleporting the party out of the museum and explaining all of this stuff. He starts having a panic attack
    > Oh acorns! I'm doing it again aren't I? I've just gotten more ivolved by teleporting you here, darn it! Oh Nibbles, you nutterbutter. Sir Nutsalot always warns me about this! Think before you cast, think before you cast. Oh , furballs! What do I do now? What would Fiddletail do? I'll teleport you back: no wait, then you'll get arrested.. or worse. Plus, I just told you all that stuff about the society! What would Nutgar do? I suppose I could just kill you... No, that doesn't seem right either.. 

    > You must forgive me, I haven't had my peanut butter yet today. I'm being terribly rude. Why don't you tell me about yourselves and what **you** want to do? 

    >  Okay here's an idea: I'll teleport you somewhere besides the museum, and we'll pretend this whole thing never happened. But you must promise not to tell Pawsworth.
