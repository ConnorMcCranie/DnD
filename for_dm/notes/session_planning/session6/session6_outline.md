# Session 6 outline

### Main ideas:

- Break into vault and find Cunning Crossbow
- Encounter with Reflective Being + Visions to start Strad's Quest
- Pointe Shoes run off (with Thalor attached DC20) to vault 420(or 69?)
- Need to use Scroll of Knock to open the vault
- Contains Kaysa's Songbook and Derek's Dance Diary (+other items for Varrin's backstory? + automoton guards?)
- Trying to rob more vaults or exiting the museum encounters guards but fairy comes out of book to play ocarina and causes chaos
- Alyona checks back in "I WAS GONE FOR 20 MINUTES WTF HAPPENED??"

### Details:
1. **Crossbow Vault**
   - Vault opens to a room with a single podium holding the Cunning Crossbow and mirrors on all walls
   -  As you approach, you notice an extra figure in the reflection who picks up the crossbow, causing the crossbow to lift in the air (but no one appears to be holding it IRL). The hooded figure in the reflection aims for the mirror and fires a bolt made of light, causing his body to appear IRL.
   -  Reflective Being fires Scattering Arrow at party to intiate combat.
   -  One he gets to half HP, casts Mirror Image. At 1/4 hp, Cunning Crossbow self-reflects to become 2 hand crossbows. 
   -  Upon touching the bow, Strad sees vision:
      -  His parents are talking to village elder.
      -  Elder warns them to discourage artificing. They protest that it's fine, but elder insists that there are forces at play beyond their knowledge. There is a prophecy that a child from this village would bring chaos with  magical items and history will repeat itself. For the good of the village, everyone must nip the curiosity about enchanting items in the bud. 

### Possible courses:
- Investigate Fairy, Dance, or Punch quest: 
    - take path NE to Enchanted Grove
    - Dance School and Tommy's Dojo/BBQ are on other side of Enchanted Grove
    - Go back to Owen's Outpost to challenge Timmy to a 1v1
- Investigate Shadowfell quests:
    - Read book about raven queen to find places where people know more about Raven queen
    - Varrin sealed off portal to Shadowfell since he considers death to be imperfect (maybe put somthing about this in the vault?)
    - Make alter to raven queen with the book (or feather?) and spend a short rest praying to her to unlock attunement
- Investigate Strad's Quest
    - Need to return to his home village or somehow learn about the prophecy
    - Entering Mirror Realm needs Invisibiliy/Blink/etc. to avoid running into yourr own reflection
- Returning to help Alyona
  - It will be a while to walk back to the Lodge. Encounter Shaman on the way back with hints about the other quests
  - Or find way to get there faster? Teleportation scrolls don't grow on trees
