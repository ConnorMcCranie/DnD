# Session 6 outline

### Main ideas:

- Break into vault and find Cunning Crossbow
- Encounter with Reflective Being + Visions to start Strad's Quest
- Pointe Shoes run off (with Thalor attached DC20) to vault 420(or 69?)
- Need to use Scroll of Knock to open the vault
- Contains Kaysa's Songbook and Derek's Dance Diary (+other items for Varrin's backstory?)
- Trying to rob more vaults or exiting the museum encounters guards but fairy comes out of book to play ocarina and causes chaos
- Alyona checks back in "I WAS GONE FOR 20 MINUTES WTF HAPPENED??"

### Possible courses:
- Investigate Fairy, Dance, or Punch quest: 
    - take path NE to Enchanted Grove
    - Dance School and Tommy's Dojo/BBQ are on other side of Enchanted Grove
    - Go back to Owen's Outpost to challenge Timmy to a 1v1
- Investigate Shadowfell quests:
    - Read book about raven queen to find places where people know more about Raven queen
    - Varrin sealed off portal to Shadowfell since he considers death to be imperfect (maybe put somthing about this in the vault?)
    - Make alter to raven queen with the book (or feather?) and spend a short rest praying to her to unlock attunement
- Investigate Strad's Quest
    - Need to return to his home village or somehow learn about the prophecy
    - Entering Mirror Realm needs Invisibiliy/Blink/etc. to avoid running into yourr own reflection
- Returning to help Alyona
  - It will be a while to walk back to the Lodge. Encounter Shaman on the way back with hints about the other quests
  - Or find way to get there faster? Teleportation scrolls don't grow on trees
