# Session 6 outline

### Main ideas:

- Break into vault and find Cunning Crossbow
- Encounter with Reflective Being + Visions to start Strad's Quest
- Pointe Shoes run off (with Thalor attached DC20) to vault 420(or 69?)
- Need to use Scroll of Knock to open the vault
- Contains Kaysa's Songbook and Derek's Dance Diary (+other items for Varrin's backstory? + automoton guards?)
- Trying to rob more vaults or exiting the museum encounters guards but fairy comes out of book to play ocarina and causes chaos
- Alyona checks back in "I WAS GONE FOR 20 MINUTES WTF HAPPENED??"

### Details:
1. **Crossbow Vault**
   - Vault opens to a room with a single podium holding the Cunning Crossbow and mirrors on all walls
   -  As you approach, you notice an extra figure in the reflection who picks up the crossbow, causing the crossbow to lift in the air (but no one appears to be holding it IRL). The hooded figure in the reflection aims for the mirror and fires a bolt made of light, causing his body to appear IRL.
   -  Reflective Being fires Scattering Arrow at party to intiate combat.
   -  One he gets to 1/2 HP, Cunning Crossbow self-reflects to become 2 hand crossbows. At 1/4 hp, he casts Mirror Image
   -  Upon touching the bow, Strad sees vision:
      -  His parents are talking to village elder.
      -  Elder warns them to discourage artificing. They protest that it's fine, but elder insists that there are forces at play beyond their knowledge. There is a prophecy that a child from this village would bring chaos with  magical items and history will repeat itself. For the good of the village, everyone must try to nip his curiosity about enchanting items in the bud. 
2. **Varinn's Vault**
   - After the mirror fight, the Pointe shoes start running off toward vault CDXX (420)
   - Using knock scroll opens to Varinn's private office. 
   > As the valut door swings open, you immediately see a large stone statue of a man who appears to be a soldier. Other than the statue, the vault looks more like an office than a museum archive. There is a single chair sat before a wide wooden desk on top of which an assortment of books and papers are scattered haphazardly. Across from the desk, a single bookshelf houses a dozen or so tomes, nothing compared to the Lavender Library's enormous collection you saw just minutes ago. Beside the bookshelf is a large metal trunk with several latches. 
    - Upon investigation of statue:
      > The statue depicts a tall, muscular man wearing soldier's armor. In his left hand, he wields a sturdy looking sheild. His right arm brandishes an ornate sword which is raised to the sky, as if commanding an attack. the statue's eyes are made of gemstones; the left eye is a sapphire and the right eye is a ruby. 
    - Investigation of desk:
       Looking closer at the papers on the desk, they mostly appear to be accounting ledgers with page after page of huge tables and calculations. One table tracks weekly expendatures on grain, beer, steel, and candles. Another has tax revenue listed for each of several districts. Directly in front of the chair is a black quill, ink bottle, and a small open booklet. The quill seems familiar for some reason and the ink on the page reveals the following entry:
        >  "It seems that my hopes for a willing conversion were ill-founded. They have far less interest in achieving perfection than previous arrivals. No matter, I'll simply have to proceed with plan B. They all have their own potential for perfection, of course, but to think that soon I'll be able to change appearance at will... How much time and effort that would have saved over the years. I wonder if this blessing is inhereted by offspring? Only time will tell. Praise be to Zarus for sending a Changeling my way!"
        
        Other entries:
          - Death is imperfect, so the portal to the shadowfell should be closed
          - The mirror realm turns out to be a surprisingly useful! Assets can be conveniently stored and easily accessed while heretics can be imprisoned without the need of guards
          - Alyona found out about the Carriers before I had a chance to ease her into it. She's being dramatic by running off into the woods, but I'm sure she'll come around eventually.  
     - Investigation of books:
       - Kaysa's songbook: flute will play itself upon opening
       - Derek's Dance Diary: Pointe shoes are trying to find it

### Possible courses:
- Investigate Fairy, Dance, or Punch quest: 
    - take path NE to Enchanted Grove
    - Dance School and Tommy's Dojo/BBQ are on other side of Enchanted Grove
    - Go back to Owen's Outpost to challenge Timmy to a 1v1
- Investigate Shadowfell quests:
    - Read book about raven queen to find places where people know more about Raven queen
    - Varrin sealed off portal to Shadowfell since he considers death to be imperfect (maybe put somthing about this in the vault?)
    - Make alter to raven queen with the book (or feather?) and spend a short rest praying to her to unlock attunement
- Investigate Strad's Quest
    - Need to return to his home village or somehow learn about the prophecy
    - Entering Mirror Realm needs Invisibiliy/Blink/etc. to avoid running into yourr own reflection
- Returning to help Alyona
  - It will be a while to walk back to the Lodge. Encounter Shaman on the way back with hints about the other quests
  - Or find way to get there faster? Teleportation scrolls don't grow on trees
