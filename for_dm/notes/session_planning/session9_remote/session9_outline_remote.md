# Session 9 Outline

### Ideas:
- Start off with Varrin capturing Alyona
- Morgana arrives on scene and demands explanation. Could either lead to 
  - fight with Morgana where she summons enslaved Shadow-Mirror Kaysa (from her pocket mirror)
  - Morgana is quick to blame the rebels and gives quest to destroy Verdant Refuge
  - Something else depending on players actions. If bargained with, Morgana wants the corset. She also may kidnap Jeremy
- Kaysa is imprisoned in mirror realm in basement of mansion. There are various puzzles around the mansion that need to be solved to access basement
- Returning back to Verdant Refuge, Charles will look at water sample and find traces of liquid metal. Suggests to ask the local blacksmith 
- Traveling salesman named Buzzworth (formerly known as Terry) similar to Beedle but bee themed. Has honey-themed potions, but also regular mechendise too. 
- Ocarina, Pointe Shoes and Corset can all get next level of attunement (Timothias shows up and challenges 1v1?)

### Details
- You hear Alyona speak telepathically 
> I have some information that may help you. I managed to sneak into Zaridel unnoticed, and I think I discovered where my body is. The reason why there are never any so-called "imprefections" around is because he sends anyone who disagrees to... *Gods above, he's here! I've got to--* 
 
Alyona goes silent. After a pregnant pause you hear Varrin's voice
   > It's always such a pity when people pass up the chance for perfection in favor of heresy. Now that this little gambit of hers is over, there is no need for you to return the orb to me. The gates of Zaridel are always open to those who seek to perfect themselves. *All others should mind their own busines*

- Morgana approaches and demands explanation for her fallen comrades.
  -  Will try to fight unless lucky skill check (DC 15 persuasion, DC 18 intimidation, DC 17 Deception, etc.).  
  -  If she is suspicious of the party's explanation, she'll cast speak with dead on Rutheford to confirm story (likely leading to fight).
  -  If fighting, she'll summon Shadow-Mirror Kaysa which forms out of liquid metal before taking fairy form.
   > Morgana takes out a small object resembling a pocket watch. Her eyes begin to glow and dark mist swirls around her feet as she chants something in a language you don't recognize. Suddenly, she opens the metal object revealing not a watch, but a mirror. A beam of light gleams from the mirror onto the ground before her where a pool of liquid metal forms, coallescing into the shape of a body. Morgana redirects the swirling dark mist directly into the metal figure, the combination of black energy fusing with the silvery metal in a horrific yet beautiful sight. Within moments, the ritual is complete and you are in the presence of an enormous necrotic fairy standing nearly 20 feet high. Other than its size, it resembles the necrotic fairies you encountered when first entering the Gallant Grasslands. 
  -   Defeating this summon leads to a lot of glitter but also the body disolves into liquid metal
