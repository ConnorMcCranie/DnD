# Session 8 Outline

### Ideas:
- There is a "safe area" called the "Verdant Refuge" where the necrotic energy is held at bay
- NPCs there take glitter as currency and hate the necrotic energy (planning rebellion?)
- Some fairies have embraced the necrotic energy and become warlocks with Raven Queen as patron
- Varinn has imprisoned Kaysa in the Mirror Realm because he views her as a "false idol"
- In order to maintain Kaysa's imprisonment, he requires extra necrotic energy, which he draws from the Shadowfell
- There is a haunted mansion where varinn does his dirty work (using a fairy body for denyability)

### Details:
> As pink glitter rains down from the sky, you notice a swarm of pixies appear from all directions, collecting the glitter like ants collecting food crumbs. As they carry off the glitter, you see a humanoid figure appear. A tall, thin female elf carrying a hunting bow approaches you and says 
> 
  > "Are y'all lost? Folks around here know not to wander into the shadows. Don't tell me you're one of Morgana's lackeys. I've got enough blood on my hands already without havin to pick another fight. "

  > "Name's Lori. I'm the ranger round these parts.. well, I used to be before the Shadows overtook the land. Now instead of roaming the land, I'm in charge of keepin the few pure places pure. Not really what I signed up for when I came, but now I got folk relyin on me that can't do it themselves. *motions to pixie that flies onto her shoulder*"
  > 
 - Lori Faewood 
    - elf ranger "mayor" of the Verdant Refuge who witnessed the gradual decay and corruption 
    - wants to find Kaysa / stage rebellion against Morgana
    - mentions to beware of giant necro guardian, describes melting behavior similar to crossbow
    - realizes that the ocarina could be the key to Kaysa's return
    - 
- Verdant Refuge
  - Safe area where a small community (mostly faries, some rangers/druids/clerics) holds back the necrotic energy
    > Dozens of pixies as well as a handful of humanoid fairies and druids chant in a circle. 
  - wanted posters of Gaelor: he came through here looking for Derek's Dance Academy for Fighters
  - Kebo-Wan's lebotamized cousin is here because he got lost looking for BBQ



- **Quest**:
    - Lori wants to dispel the shadows, but for some reason dispel magic and other typical methods aren't working. This ritual has to be continually cast in order to keep the Verdant Refuge safe. 
    - The darkness is centered around Kaysa's Great Fairy Fountain. The water that used to be crystal clear is now pure black. 
    - Get a sample of the contaminated water so the Verdant Refuge's alchemist can determine the nature of the curse
    - The Grim Gloomlands are now inhabited by evil warlocks and Morgana is their "mayor". You don't want a fight with Morg if you can avoid it 


- Mayor Morgana 
  - took power in the void left by Kaysa
  - dark fairy who has embraced the necrotic energy by becoming a warlock (with raven queen as patron)
  - wants the corset
  - in league with varinn
  
- Dont forget
  - Other entries of Varinn's diary
          - Death is imperfect, so all portals to the shadowfell should be controlled. However, the power that lies there is immense. Perhaps there is a way to channel that energy toward the glory of Zarus...
          - The mirror realm turns out to be a surprisingly useful! Assets can be conveniently stored and easily accessed while heretics can be imprisoned without the need of guards
          - Alyona found out about the Carriers before I had a chance to ease her into it. She's being dramatic by running off into the woods, but I'm sure she'll come around eventually.  
  - Dance shoe shenanigans
  - kebo wans arms tired
  - alyona communicates one last time 
    > "I think I found out where my body is. Varinn keeps all of his... Seven hells, he's here. How did he..?"
