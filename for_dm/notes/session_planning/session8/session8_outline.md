# Session 8 Outline

### Ideas:
- There is a "safe area" called the "Verdant Refuge" where the necrotic energy is held at bay
- NPCs there take glitter as currency and hate the necrotic energy (planning rebellion?)
- Some fairies have embraced the necrotic energy and become warlocks with Raven Queen as patron
- Varinn has imprisoned Kaysa in the Mirror Realm because he views her as a "false idol"
- In order to maintain Kaysa's imprisonment, he requires extra necrotic energy, which he draws from the Shadowfell
- There is a haunted mansion where varinn does his dirty work (using a fairy body for denyability)

### Details:
- Verdant Refuge
  - Safe area where a small community (mostly faries, some rangers/druids/clerics) holds back the necrotic energy
  - wanted posters of Gaelor
  - Kebo-Wan's lebotamized cousin is here because he got lost looking for BBQ

- Lori Faewood 
  - elf ranger "mayor" of the Verdant Refuge who witnessed the gradual decay and corruption 
  - wants to find Kaysa / stage rebellion
  - mentions to beware of giant necro guardian, describes melting behavior similar to crossbow
  - realizes that the ocarina could be the key to Kaysa's return

- Mayor Morgana 
  - took power in the void left by Kaysa
  - dark fairy who has embraced the necrotic energy by becoming a warlock (with raven queen as patron)
