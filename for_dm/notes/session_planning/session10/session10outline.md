# Session 9 Outline

### Ideas:
- Vaaneth goes into mirror realm and hears screams/ocarina/talking coming from void
  - Varinn speaks telepathically and warns not to interfere: tries to use orb to control her
  - if she resists, can somehow free a fragment of Kaysa's spirit which manifests as a pixie sprite who sings meodies and iluuminates the darkness.
  - if she defies Varinn, he tries to steal Jeremy
- Returning back to Verdant Refuge, Charles will look at water sample and find traces of liquid metal. Suggests to ask the local blacksmith 
- Traveling salesman named Buzzworth (formerly known as Terry) similar to Beedle but bee themed. Has honey-themed potions, but also regular mechendise too. 
- There are 2 other kaysa fragments which need to be freed: one under the Luminous Lake and one in the Glimmerglade Grove
  - Gilmmerglade Grove has a puzzle Puzzles_Predicaments_and_Perplexities pg.20 and also serves as a dungeon
  - Luminous Lake is swarming with warlocks and the dark orb is at the bottom of the lake. To access it, they'll have to traverse the maze and find the keywords which unlocks tunnel to bottom of lake
  - The warlocks use pocket mirrors on the lake which makes the liquid metal appear in the water while dark energy flows out of the water into their mirror. This is how they have warlock powers without technically being warlocks and why there is metal in kaysa's fountain water. 

### Details
- Before entering the mirror, DC17 wis save to see if Varinn can scry on them. If sucessful, he warns them not to interfere. 
- Upon entering mirror, 
    > As you step through the mirror, the pulsating sound becomes louder and louder. What before sounded like a muddled warbling now becomes a sea of distinct sounds. All at once you hear screaming, whispering, laughing, and crying. (Roll Perception DC14 to hear Alyona's voice screaming) Suddenly, the sounds fade to the back of your consciousness and you hear the Raven Queen:
    "So that's where it's been hiding"
    Quoth flies before the mass of swirling black energy and opens his beak **CAW** the sound echos as the necrotic energy starts get sucked into Quoth's beak. The spherical black orb starts to swirl and unravel as this spectral raven somehow absorbs more and more of it until... Your pupils contract when the all encompassing blackness is replaced by a bright pulsating light and you take 1d4 radiant damage, ending your invisibility. 

  > The rest of you see the mirror glow with light and suddenly shatter, leaving Vaaneth lying on the ground disoriented. Above her hovers a pixie who radiates a glowing pink light. This pixe is much larger than the ones you saw back at the Verdant Refuge, though still only about 6 inches tall. The pixie smiles excitedly and sings *aah-ah-aaah*
