# Session 10 Outline

### Ideas:
- Vaaneth goes into mirror realm and hears screams/ocarina/talking coming from void
  - Varinn speaks telepathically and warns not to interfere: tries to use orb to control her
  - if she resists, can somehow free a fragment of Kaysa's spirit which manifests as a pixie sprite who sings meodies and iluuminates the darkness.
  - if she defies Varinn, he tries to steal Jeremy
- Returning back to Verdant Refuge, Charles will look at water sample and find traces of liquid metal. Suggests to ask the local blacksmith 
- Traveling salesman named Buzzworth (formerly known as Terry) similar to Beedle but bee themed. Has honey-themed potions, but also regular mechendise too. 
- There are 2 other kaysa fragments which need to be freed: one under the Luminous Lake and one in the Glimmerglade Grove
  - Gilmmerglade Grove has a puzzle Puzzles_Predicaments_and_Perplexities pg.20 and also serves as a dungeon
  - Luminous Lake is swarming with warlocks and the dark orb is at the bottom of the lake. To access it, they'll have to traverse the maze and find the keywords which unlocks tunnel to bottom of lake
  - The warlocks use pocket mirrors on the lake which makes the liquid metal appear in the water while dark energy flows out of the water into their mirror. This is how they have warlock powers without technically being warlocks and why there is metal in kaysa's fountain water. 

### Details

**At Mansion**
- Before entering the mirror, DC17 wis save to see if Varinn can scry on them. If sucessful, he warns them not to interfere. 
- Upon entering mirror, 
    > As you step through the mirror, the pulsating sound becomes louder and louder. What before sounded like a muddled warbling now becomes a sea of distinct sounds. All at once you hear screaming, whispering, laughing, and crying. (Roll Perception DC14 to hear Alyona's voice screaming) Suddenly, the sounds fade to the back of your consciousness and you hear the Raven Queen:
    "So that's where it's been hiding"
    Quoth flies before the mass of swirling black energy and opens his beak **CAW** the sound echos as the necrotic energy starts get sucked into Quoth's beak. The spherical black orb starts to swirl and unravel as this spectral raven somehow absorbs more and more of it until... Your pupils contract when the all encompassing blackness is replaced by a bright pulsating light and you take 1d4 radiant damage, ending your invisibility. 

  > The rest of you see the mirror glow with light and suddenly shatter, leaving Vaaneth lying on the ground disoriented. Above her hovers a pixie who radiates a glowing pink light. This pixe is much larger than the ones you saw back at the Verdant Refuge, though still only about 6 inches tall. The pixie smiles excitedly and sings *aah-ah-aaah*

- **On the way back, Varinn confronts them**
  >  Using stolen artifacts to kill the mayor, breaking and entering into her home, and then tampering with the contents of her private vault. You are quite the naughty bunch, aren't you? But even the most wretched souls are not abandoned by Zarus! If you ask him for forgiveness and strive for perfection, He will show you the way! One last chance: *There are things at play here that don't concern you. Stop meddling or it will get messy.* Why don't you come back to Zaridel with me? Now that the Eye of Zarus has been retrieved, you can all have a perfect, happy lives there. 
  - If they refuse, uses Hold person on everyone (DC17 wis) and uses Suggesetion (DC17 Wis) on Jeremy and says
  > "Come with me, Jeremy. Wouldn't you like to see Alyona again? I'll take you to see her"
  
  - If no one resists, then he'll kidnap Jeremey and imprison him in the mirror realm too (Uses Dimension Door to teleport away). If anyone resists and interrupts him, he will simply teleport away.

&nbsp;

- **Back at Verdant Refuge**
- Lori 
  - is curious if there were any leads found about Kaysa
  > I *knew* that Morgana was up to no good. I don't know what this means, but that's the most biggest pixie I've ever seen! 
  - Sprite is excited by the chanting cirlce in the center of town and goes over there to sing. The radius of the pink bubble shoots outwards, and the anti-necrotic force field expands to twice its previous size. As the residents look on in disbelief, they forget to keep chanting and the bubble shrinks back down to its original size. It seems this one pixie can singlehandedly push back as much negative energy as the dozens of resident magic users and pixies who now stand in shock, as if they are unsure what to do with themselves now that their burden has been momentarily lifted. 
  > Well, I ain't never... Kaysa's spirit hasn't abandoned us after all.. This could be the answer! (Where did you find this pixie?) You say this pixie was imprisoned right? That's got to do with the darkness! Maybe there's others imprisoned too. If we freed more of them, the bubble might get so big that it covers all the grasslands!
- Charles 
  - rewards Strad with "potion of speed" (but it was not made correctly, so the lethargic effect occurs *before* the haste effect instead of afterwards)
  - Separates out some liquid metal from the sample of fountain water. Shows that pixie dust cures the leftover water once the metal is removed
  - Suggests that the local blacksmith Thalia might know what kind of metal it is
- Buzzworth
  - Travelling merchant like Beedle who has honey-themed potions and also regular items
  - "Buzz-inga!, Bee-yond!, Swarm-azing!" 
  - Why do bees have sticky hair? Because they always use honeycombs!
  - What do you call a bee that can’t make up its mind? A may-bee!
  - What’s a bee’s favorite hairstyle? A buzz cut!
- Thalia Ironhand
  > Thalia Ironhand is a sturdy dwarf, standing at about 4 feet tall, with a robust and muscular build that speaks to her years spent at the forge.  Thalia sports a thick, intricately braided beard that reaches down to her chest, adorned with small metal beads and decorative clasps that reflect her craftsmanship.
  - Drawven blacksmith  who arrived in the village years ago, seeking solace after a devastating battle against necrotic forces. 
  - Lost her brother Thorn to the dark warlocks, 
  - experiments with incorporating pixie dust into metals. 
  - When asked about the cunning crossbow, her theory is that the metal behaves as liquid because it still needs to be quenched and tempered
  > Whoever made this didn't finish tempering it. I can't say I understand the magic behind it, but I do know this: the colder metal gets, the harder it gets. Even the softest metals I work with harden right up when I quench them in the water trough. But this metal seems to be nearly liquid, even when submerged in water. On one hand this is great if you still wanna put it in a mold. Right now its shaped like a light crossbow, but we could pour it into this heavy crossbow mold to change how it handles. Or if you prefer something smaller, I could make it into a hand crossbow. Actually, there's enough material so I could make 2 hand crossbows if you are the dual-wielding type. However, none of that'll do any good unless we can figure out a way to make it solid. 

- Timmothias the Tenacious
  - Talking to Kebo-Wan's cousin. Wants to find the tenderizers
  - Challenges Kebowan to 1v1. 

&nbsp;

- **Glimmerglade Grove**
  > There is a door with no visible handles or locks. There are several scenes carved into and around the door, all depicting portrayals of two or more humanoid figures
standing in groups. Several races are represented among the figures - from left to right there are depictions of a halfling, an elf, a fairy, a dragonborn, a human, and a dwarf. There are statues on either side of the door; the one on the left depicts an elven ranger with a bow and quiver slung across her back, arms spread wide in a friendly gesture. At the bottom is the enscriptopn "Aestar" (Evlish for "together"). The statue on the right depicts a tall dragonborn barbarian wielding a two-handed axe and holding it in position to swing downwards with a ferocious attack. The enscription at the bottom says "Re" in draconic.

- players need to navigate the Glimmerglade Grove in order to find the remaining statues. Once they find them all, saying the passphrase aloud will open the door, which holds yet another dark orb. Also, there is a staircase which leads to a secret passageway underneath the lake.
