# Session 9 Outline

### Ideas:
- Start off with Varrin capturing Alyona
- Morgana arrives on scene and demands explanation. Could either lead to 
  - fight with Morgana where she summons enslaved Shadow-Mirror Kaysa (from her pocket mirror)
  - Morgana is quick to blame the rebels and gives quest to destroy Verdant Refuge
  - Something else depending on players actions. If bargained with, Morgana wants the corset. She also may kidnap Jeremy
- Kaysa is imprisoned in mirror realm in basement of mansion. There are various puzzles around the mansion that need to be solved to access basement
- Returning back to Verdant Refuge, Charles will look at water sample and find traces of liquid metal. Suggests to ask the local blacksmith 
- Traveling salesman named Buzzworth (formerly known as Terry) similar to Beedle but bee themed. Has honey-themed potions, but also regular mechendise too. 
- Ocarina, Pointe Shoes and Corset can all get next level of attunement (Timothias shows up and challenges 1v1?)

### Details
- You hear Alyona speak telepathically 
> I have some information that may help you. I managed to sneak into Zaridel unnoticed, and I think I discovered where my body is. The reason why there are never any so-called "imprefections" around is because he sends anyone who disagrees to... *Gods above, he's here! I've got to--* 
 
Alyona goes silent. After a pregnant pause you hear Varrin's voice
   > It's always such a pity when people pass up the chance for perfection in favor of heresy. Now that this little gambit of hers is over, there is no need for you to return the orb to me. The gates of Zaridel are always open to those who seek to perfect themselves. *All others should mind their own busines*

- **Morgana approaches and demands explanation for her fallen comrades.**
  -  Will try to fight unless lucky skill check (DC 15 persuasion, DC 18 intimidation, DC 17 Deception, etc.).  
  -  If she is suspicious of the party's explanation, she'll cast speak with dead on Rutheford to confirm story (likely leading to fight).
  -  If fighting, she'll summon Shadow-Mirror Kaysa which forms out of liquid metal before taking fairy form.
   > Morgana takes out a small object resembling a pocket watch. Her eyes begin to glow and dark mist swirls around her feet as she chants something in a language you don't recognize. Suddenly, she opens the metal object revealing not a watch, but a mirror. A beam of light gleams from the mirror onto the ground before her where a pool of liquid metal forms, coallescing into the shape of a body. Morgana redirects the swirling dark mist directly into the metal figure, the combination of black energy fusing with the silvery metal in a horrific yet beautiful sight. Within moments, the ritual is complete and you are in the presence of an enormous necrotic fairy standing nearly 20 feet high. Other than its size, it resembles the necrotic fairies you encountered when first entering the Gallant Grasslands. 
   -  **Don't forget:** 
      -  *Glitter makes ocarina play song of healing, unlocking next level of ocarina*
      -  *Timmy's Trainers make arms tired: penalty to-hit is increased to -3*
  -   Defeating this summon leads to a lot of glitter but also the body disolves into liquid metal.  
  - (Optional) Morgana tries to obtain the corset
  - (Optional) Morgana uses her pocket mirror to trap Jeremy in the Mirror Realm

- **Back at Verdant Refuge**
  - Lori 
    - is curious if there were any leads found about Kaysa
    - is now sure that Morgana is perpetuating the darkness somehow, recommends searching her mansion
  - Charles 
    - rewards Strad with "potion of speed" (but it was not made correctly, so the lethargic effect occurs *before* the haste effect instead of afterwards)
    - Separates out some liquid metal from the sample of fountain water. Shows that pixie dust cures the leftover water once the metal is removed
    - Suggests that the local blacksmith Thalia might know what kind of metal it is
  - Buzzworth
    - Travelling merchant like Beedle who has honey-themed potions and also regular items
    - "Buzz-inga!, Bee-yond!, Swarm-azing!" 
    - Why do bees have sticky hair? Because they always use honeycombs!
    - What do you call a bee that can’t make up its mind? A may-bee!
    - What’s a bee’s favorite hairstyle? A buzz cut!
  - Thalia Ironhand
    > Thalia Ironhand is a sturdy dwarf, standing at about 4 feet tall, with a robust and muscular build that speaks to her years spent at the forge.  Thalia sports a thick, intricately braided beard that reaches down to her chest, adorned with small metal beads and decorative clasps that reflect her craftsmanship.
    - Drawven blacksmith  who arrived in the village years ago, seeking solace after a devastating battle against necrotic forces. 
    - Lost her brother Thorn to the dark warlocks, 
    - experiments with incorporating pixie dust into metals. 
    - When asked about the cunning crossbow, her theory is that the metal behaves as liquid because it still needs to be quenched and tempered
    > Whoever made this didn't finish tempering it. I can't say I understand the magic behind it, but I do know this: the colder metal gets, the harder it gets. Even the softest metals I work with harden right up when I quench them in the water trough. But this metal seems to be nearly liquid, even when fully submerged in the water! Apparently you'll need something a lot colder than water to solidfy it.

- **Mansion**
  - 5 lever puzzle
    > A primary first helps open the door
    The second lever will sound like a roar
    The last lever pulled is the color of sky
    After the second will buzz like a fly.
    - color:sounds = black:roar,yellow:buzz,blue:flute,green:wind,red:bell
    - correct answer red,black,yellow,green, blue
    - correct order opens a compartment with triangle lock key 
    > "Five from the right with 3 inbetween"

  - triangle key puzzle to get in top right room
    - "Five from the right with 3 inbetween" key dropped by Morg
  - alter to ravevn queen in back
    > " Embrace the shadows within you, disciple of the night. Follow the raven's call and you shall become a part of the flock: a member of the *unkindness*.  I bestow upon you this gift, for a mirror can only reflect that which can be seen."
