# Session 5 Outline

#### Main Ideas:
- Party gets to Lavendar Library and Alyona speaks to them again
- They must figure out a way to the Archive, which is only available to authorized members
- Party meets **Stradivar** at the cafe
- Varinn shows up and gives the party one last chance to join him (or else he'll retrieve the orb himself)
- Once they find the item clues, they can go to Mystic Museum via the Library's teleportation circle network
- Mystic Museum is like a public museum with exhibits and stuff in the front, gift shop, etc., 
- Getting the needed magical items will require some kind of heist

#### Details

- Upon pulling the lever at the end of the Labyrinth, party appears on teleportation circle in front of Lavender Library
  - Alyona speaks telepathically 
    > "There you are! I don't know how, but the orb's power wasn't working when I tried to find you inside the mountain. There must have been some type of magical interference preventing outside help. I'm relieved that you actually managed to make it to the Library. I need the orb's full power as soon as possible. So far I've evaded and pushed back Varinn's men, but they've taken to burning the forest in order to force me out. Varinn sickens me to my core, willing to destroy the beauty of nature for the sake of unchecked power. I don't know why, but Varinn has yet to show up himself, only ever sending more of his followers.   Even with the help of the animals, the licorice, and my druidic powers, I'm getting stretched too thin. If Varinn were to challenge me directly, I fear I would have to surrender. I'd rather never get my body back than let Varinn burn the whole forest to the ground. If you can tell me the secret of the orb, then I'd be able to deflect his men with ease. Please, I'm counting on you!"
  - Players enter the lobby, and are greeted by the **Gaelor** a Harengon (rabbit-folk) librarian.
    - Gaelor congradulates them on passing the test and takes their pictures to print out their library cards, and gives voucher for free Lavender Latte. 
    > "Welcome to the Lavender Library, the realm's largest collection of arcane tomes, magical scrolls, comprehensive treatises, cryptic texts, and, of course, publisher of Wizard Weekly, winner of Best Magical Magizine 372 years in a row! Make sure to check out this week's article "Mastering the Mirror Realm: 6 Common Mistakes Traversing Alternate Planes and How to Avoid Them." 
    - Gaelor says that bears are not permitted in the library and players will have to figure out a way to deal with that
  - There is a Cafe called The Sorcerer's Sips, which serves Lavender Latte that restores all health and spell slots (including ki points, sorcerer points, etc.). Cost: 100gp but new memebers get first drink for free.
- Encounter Stradivar at cafe or wherever they go first
- Perception/Investigation for books (see library_books)
- Attempting to get to Auxiliary Archive of Attunement is met with bureaucracy: 
  - *only authorized personnel allowed inside*, and there is a long waiting list for checking out items. The ones for their personal items are already checked out (by Varinn)
  - the library wants you to get a premium subscription: 300gp or equivalent in donation of tomes/scrolls per full moon for 1st tier subscription all the way up to 3000gp for 9th tier subscription (Gaelor gives hard sell)
  - party will have to find a way in either by sneaking (DC 17) or persuading Gaelor (DC 19) or siding with Varinn or whatever else they come up with. For example, once they learn that Varinn is authorized and has returned the clues they could use deception to say they are guests of Varinn (DC 17) or Vaaneth could impersonate Varinn (DC 17 advantage). Maybe Stradivar could help somehow by being an artificer and convincing that this is necessary for his training?
- Encounter with Varinn, who has lvl 9 subscription and has the item attunement clues 
  - Questions why they are here instead of retriving the Left Eye as was agreed (He has passive insight 18, so it will be very tough to convince him that they didn't betray him)
  - Offers them ultimatum: either they retrieve the Left Eye as was originally agreed upon and he'll give them the clues about the items OR he will get the Left Eye from Alyona himself, return the clues to the library (and they'll have made a very powerful enemy)
  - He can cast Hold Person (DC 16) on them using Right Eye if they attack, and he has Bend Luck (add 1d4 to DC for 2 sorcery points) + Heightened Spell (give disadvantage for 3 sorcery points: he has 7 total) in case they resist.
