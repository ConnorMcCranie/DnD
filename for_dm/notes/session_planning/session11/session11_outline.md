- **Glimmerglade Grove**
  > There is a door with no visible handles or locks. There are several scenes carved into and around the door, all depicting portrayals of two or more humanoid figures
standing in groups. Several races are represented among the figures - from left to right there are depictions of a halfling, an elf, a fairy, a dragonborn, a human, and a dwarf. There are statues on either side of the door; the one on the left depicts an elven ranger with a bow and quiver slung across her back, arms spread wide in a friendly gesture. At the bottom is the enscriptopn "Aestar" (Evlish for "together"). The statue on the right depicts a tall dragonborn barbarian wielding a two-handed axe and holding it in position to swing downwards with a ferocious attack. The enscription at the bottom says "Re" in draconic.
