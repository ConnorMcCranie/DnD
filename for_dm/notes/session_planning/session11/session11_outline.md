# Session 11 Outline
- **Recap:**
  - Freed a mysterious fairy sprite from inside a ball of dark energy within the mirror realm. The spite can't talk and simply sings/hums. It is able to power the pink bubble keeping the Verdant Refuge safe
  - Varinn confronted the group and kidnapped Jeremy 
  - Fought some slime monsters (Thalor used some slime as skin moisturizer)
  - Bought some merch from Buzzworth
  - Brought the water sample to Charles who identified that there is liquid metal within the water
  - Met Thalia Ironforge, who suggested that the liquid metal could be tempered if cold enough. She also was enamored with Kebo-Wan and offered to enrich their weapons with pixie dust
  - Kebo-Wan found his cousin Charkee taling to old man Timothias. Kebo-Wan fought Timothias 1v1, but he got wrecked (especially in the kidneys). Still, Timothias was impressed enough that he allowed him to keep training with the Tenderizers. 
  - Lori requested that they look for more sprites. Strad/Vaaneth negotiated that since the GDP (grasslands domestic product) would increase, they should get property in return.

- **Glimmerglade Grove**
  > There is a door with no visible handles or locks. There are several scenes carved into and around the door, all depicting portrayals of two or more humanoid figures
standing in groups. Several races are represented among the figures - from left to right there are depictions of a halfling, an elf, a fairy, a dragonborn, a human, and a dwarf. There are statues on either side of the door; the one on the left depicts an elven ranger with a bow and quiver slung across her back, arms spread wide in a friendly gesture. At the bottom is the enscriptopn "Aestar" (Evlish for "together"). The statue on the right depicts a tall dragonborn barbarian wielding a two-handed axe and holding it in position to swing downwards with a ferocious attack. The enscription at the bottom says "Re" in draconic.
