*(Tenderize)* Your unarmed attacks apply the `Tenderized` effect which lasts for one round. Each additional unarmed attack you land on a `Tenderized` creature deals +1 bludgeoning damage and refreshes the duration of `Tenderized`. 

*(Requires Attunement)* The `Tenderized` efffect now stacks up to 5 times. A creature with 5 stacks of `Tenderized` becomes `Fully Tender`, at which point the bonus damage on further attacks is increased to +2 and the number required to crit is 19. 
:
*(Requires Auxillary Attunement)* Your unaramed attacks ignore resistance and deal half damage against immunity. The `Tenderized` effect now stacks any number of times and at 10 stacks becomes `Falling Off The Bone`: the bonus damage is increased to +3 and the number required to crit is 18. For each additional 4 stacks beyond 10, the bonus damage is increased by 1 and the number required to crit is decreased by 1 (minimum 2).
