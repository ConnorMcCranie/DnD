# Session 1

- Players are travelling in a carriage toward Zaridel when a hitchhiker named Alyona joins them. She says that something important to her was stolen by Varinn and that she intends to get it back. 
- Upon arriving to Zaridel, the party is greeted by Brother Marth, who recognizes Alyona. Immediately, Alyona rushes out of the carriage at super-human speed without explanation 

- Brother Marth guides the party into a large cathedral in the center of Zaridel. 
- The party watches a ballet, and Thalor participates. 
- Vaaneth notices that all the townspeople are humans and look similar to one another. She changes her appearance to match that the crowd, and they respond by saying that she looks much more perfect than before. 
  - They are surprised not by the mere fact that she changed into a human, but rather by how *sudden* the change was and say 
    > "You have increased your perfection much faster than anyone before. You must be chosen by Zarus! He has blessed our town by sending you to us."

- Varinn changes the subject by saying there is now going to be a feast in the dining hall and Varinn invites them to his table.
-  Alarm bells start ringing and Brother Marth runs up to Varinn and says "There is an emergency! The Left Eye of Zarus has been stolen!" 
-  Varinn says he knows who must have stolen it and asks the party to help retrieve it in return for a reward. 
-  The party agrees to help and Varinn offers to let them stay in a tavern for free. The party lodges at the luxurious tavern for the night.

# Session 2

- Players are awoken by Brother Mathias who serves them delicious egg and cheese mini-quiches 
- Varinn informs the party that the theif was spotted heading west into the forest
  -  He says that this part of the forest is near an old hunting cabin called Lucky Deer Lodge
  -  He requests that the party set out to retrieve the orb as soon as possible, but offers that they can stop by the town merchant first if they need any supplies
  -  Kebo-Wan says he doesn't have any money and convinces Varinn to provide a line of credit for 20gp per traveler
- Brother Mathias escorts the party to the merchant and they buy some items:
  - Vaaneth: Scroll of Knock, 15gp
  - Kebo-Wan: Potion of Health, 15gp
  - Thalor: Magenta-dyed whip, 7gp
  - Moosra: Blow gun + 20 ammunition, 20gp
- Kebo-Wan wants something to imprrove his punching power, but the shopkeeper doesn't have anything like that. Thalor suggests that maybe a meat tenderizer could do the trick.
- Brother Mathias protests that the butcher is unlikely to have something like that, but reluctantly leads the party to the Butcher shop:
  - Kebo-Wan asks the butcher for something to increase his punching power and the butcher is confused why they're here if not to buy meat.
  - When he responds by snarkily suggesting that Kebo-Wan needs to learn what punching is, Kebo-Wan loses his temper and punches a hanging piece of meat, which explodes all over the floor and walls from the forceful punch. 
  - This leads to the party being thrown out of (and permanently banned from) the butcher shop
  - Brother Mathias insists that they proceed to their quest, but now Moosra wants honey. Exhasperated by these irrelevant errands, he runs off and returns with a jar of honey for her. 
- Finally, the party is ushered out the front gate of Zaridel, and Mathias points them in the direction of Lucky Deer Cabin
- The party begins walking down the trail and hears a familiar (female) voice inside their head say 
  > "Don't try to stop me; There is more at play here than you know. I can explain everything.
  > Varinn is not who he seems." -Alyona
  - A thourough examination of the surrounding area reveals no other creatures around them except for a deer which promptly runs away 
  - The party discusses the possibility of double-crossing Varinn by helping Alyona instead of retrieving the orb from her
- Further down the road, the party stumbles across a mine being run by some gnomes, halflings, and dwarves:
   > "My prayers to Zarus haven't been answered today either, but either way this coal still needs to get mined. Get back to work!" - Zarunite Miner
   - Vaarin attempts to decieve the miners by shapeshifting into a halfling while the rest of the party hides.
   - The miners hand her a pickaxe since they think she is there to work. 
   - After some confusion, they tell her that the Lucky Deer Lodge is about 2 miles due west into the forest past a stream
 - The party proceeds into the forest toward the cabin and soon notice that vegetation is becoming thicker and thicker. Some are even tropical plants that wouldn't typically grow in a mountainous climate such as thick vines, mango trees, and licorice root
 - Moosra uses Speak with Animals to talk to a nearby prairie dog who goes on a long rant about his underground tunnels:
    > "Sometimes in life you get caught up in the little things. You gotta remember; it's about the **tunnels** !"
    - Moosra feeds the jar of honey to the prairie dog and swoops in to kiss him on the forehead before he runs back into his hole
 - Upon reaching the river, the party is suddenly attacked by angry squirrels and a pack of wolves. 
 - After defeating the animals, the party hears Alyona in their minds again:
   - She warns them again to stay out of this, but the party says they're here to help
   - Alyona suspects a trap and demands that they somehow prove their intent
   - The entire party performs the electric slide, which adequately convinces Alyona that they aren't loyal to Varinn
   - Alyona invites them to meet her at the Lucky Deer Lodge where she will explain what this is all about  
  - After the telepathic voice stops talking, a doe runs past them toward the cabin and clears the river in one jump
