# Session 6 outline

### Main ideas:

- Break into vault and find Cunning Crossbow
- Encounter with Reflective Being + Visions to start Strad's Quest
- Pointe Shoes run off (with Thalor attached DC20) to vault 420
- Need to use Scroll of Knock to open the vault
- Contains Kaysa's Songbook and Derek's Dance Diary and Raven Queen's Feather
- Trying to rob more vaults or exiting the museum encounters guards but fairy comes out of book to play ocarina and causes chaos
- Alyona checks back in "I WAS GONE FOR 20 MINUTES WTF HAPPENED??"

### Details:
1. **Crossbow Vault**
   - Vault opens to a room with a single podium holding the Cunning Crossbow and mirrors on all walls
   -  As you approach, you notice an extra figure in the reflection who picks up the crossbow, causing the crossbow to lift in the air (but no one appears to be holding it IRL). The hooded figure in the reflection aims for the mirror and fires a bolt made of light, causing his body to appear IRL.
   -  Reflective Being fires Scattering Arrow at party to intiate combat.
   -  One he gets to 1/2 HP, Cunning Crossbow self-reflects to become 2 hand crossbows. At 1/4 hp, he casts Mirror Image
   -  Upon touching the bow, Strad sees vision:
      -  His parents are talking to village elder.
      -  Elder warns them to discourage artificing. They protest that it's fine, allbeit unconventional for the town norms. But the elder insists that there are forces at play beyond their knowledge. There is a prophecy that a child from this village would bring chaos with  magical items and history will repeat itself. For the good of the village, everyone must try to stop his curiosity about enchanting magical items.
2. **Varinn's Vault**
   - After the mirror fight, the Pointe shoes start running off toward vault CDXX (420)
   - Using knock scroll opens to Varinn's private office. 
   > As the valut door swings open, you immediately see a large stone statue of a man who appears to be a soldier. Other than the statue, the vault looks more like an office than a museum archive. There is a single chair sat before a wide wooden desk on top of which an assortment of books and papers are scattered haphazardly. Across from the desk, a single bookshelf houses a dozen or so tomes, nothing compared to the Lavender Library's enormous collection you saw just minutes ago. Beside the bookshelf is a large metal trunk with several latches. 
    - Upon investigation of statue:
      > The statue depicts a tall, muscular man wearing soldier's armor. In his left hand, he wields a sturdy looking sheild. His right arm brandishes an ornate sword which is raised to the sky, as if commanding an attack. the statue's eyes are made of gemstones; the left eye is a sapphire and the right eye is a ruby. 
    - Investigation of desk:
       Looking closer at the papers on the desk, they mostly appear to be accounting ledgers with page after page of huge tables and calculations. One table tracks weekly expendatures on grain, beer, steel, and candles. Another has tax revenue listed for each of several districts. Directly in front of the chair is a black quill, ink bottle, and a small open booklet. The quill seems familiar for some reason and the ink on the page reveals the following entry:
        >  "It seems that my hopes for a willing conversion were ill-founded. They have far less interest in achieving perfection than previous arrivals. No matter, I'll simply have to proceed with plan B. They all have their own potential for perfection, of course, but to think that soon I'll be able to change appearance at will... How much time and effort that would have saved over the years. I wonder if this blessing is inhereted by offspring? Only time will tell. Praise be to Zarus for sending a Changeling my way!"
        
        Other entries:
          - Death is imperfect, so the portal to the shadowfell should be closed
          - The mirror realm turns out to be a surprisingly useful! Assets can be conveniently stored and easily accessed while heretics can be imprisoned without the need of guards
          - Alyona found out about The Carriers before I had a chance to explain it to her properly. She's being dramatic by running off into the woods, but I'm sure she'll come around eventually.  
     - Investigation of books:
       - Kaysa's songbook: flute will play itself upon opening
       - Derek's Dance Diary: Pointe shoes are trying to find it
  3. **Blame Gaelor**
     - After exiting Varinn's vault, guards will come, but the ocarina puts them to sleep
     - optional: Jeremey swats his paw at the floating ocarina and an ethereal fairy comes out and passes through Jeremy's head. It giggles playfully and another song plays itself, which teleports the party back to the shop in Owen's Outpost where they originally bought honey. Jeremy happily eats the honey out of the jar to the shopkeeper's shagrin
     - optional: Nibbles teleports them out and explains that he feels partly responsible for these happenings
     - Alyona resumes telepathic communication and let's them know why she stopped talking (to gouge out her own eye) as well as expressing disbelief that they pulled a museum heist in the 30 minutes that she was gone (or confused that they are back in owens outpost so quickly depending when she contacts) 
     - Regardless of what happens, Gaelor gets blamed for breaking into the museum since Vaaneth shapeshifted into him and he scanned his ID card and then Gaelor disappeared afterwards. There is a bounty put out for him, and he doesn't return after Charm Person wears off (He is going to Derek's Dance Academy for Fighters).
  4. **Introduce Nibbles**  
      - Somewhere along their trail, they encounter Nibbles Cleverwhisker who is amused by the party's shenanigans.
      - Displays awesome ability by casting Fireball, Enlarge, Telekenesis, etc. 
      -  He usually doesn't like to get involved in these things but will help if doing so helps keep the balance of the realm. 
         >"Just call my name and I'll be able to find you. Whether or not I feel like doing so depends on my mood though."

- Investigate Shadowfell quests:
    - Read book about raven queen to find places where people know more about Raven queen
