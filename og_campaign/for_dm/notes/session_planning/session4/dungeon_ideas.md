## Dungeon ideas:

#### Narcissist Puzzle

- You enter a room (can be a bedroom or a room filled with chest(s). I suggest having the room be slightly cluttered with objects/clothing) and see a statue staring into a mirror with a slight smile on there face. As you approach the statue it looks up and say's "Only the most beautiful may pass" (feel free to come up with something more clever) and then looks back into the mirror.

- In the chests, or around the room there are various articles of clothing. Some of those articles of clothing are the same as the articles of clothing that the statue is wearing. Once one of the party members wears a matching set of clothing to the statue (the statue will comment on your sense of style/beauty) will the door appear.

- If they approach not wearing matching articles of clothes the statue sneers and says "why would I let someone so hideous pass" (once again feel free to come up with something more clever) and have the statue summon some sort of monster (perhaps a succubus/incubus, or whatever you think is appropriate I am relatively new to DnD).

- Bonus Item: If, in addition, to the players changing into the same set of clothing, they use some sort of illusion spell to mimic the statues face, the statue gushes over there beauty and awards them with a magic item: Narcissist's Charm: +1 Charisma and ability to cast charm person 1/long rest. This item can be anything from a ring, to a medallion to a gaudy pink hat depending on the tone of your campaign.

    - If players have trouble figuring out the puzzle either have the statue go on and on about themselves, or leave clues such as a journal showering themselves with praise.

#### Blood Wall 
- The party enters a room with a stone wall and a locked door. The wall has a riddle engraved in it; "The key is found within you head, use the key to paint me red, be aware of what you spurn, for what you give shall be returned." The party must use blood and smear it on the wall(where they get it from is up to them), and a duplicate of what the blood came from emerges out of the wall. The party must fight and defeat the duplicate to unlock the door.

#### The "One Way" Hall 
- A Hallway that looks normal but ends in a dead end. When you turn around there is a wall 5 ft behind you. You are now stuck. The wall appears solid. On the end wall there is writing saying "keep your eye here and you may escape." 
- The player has to look at the writing and walk backwards to escape the hallway.

#### Paper Seal

- The door to a room is sealed with a small piece of paper (It cannot be broken or burned by magic or torn by weapons). A small crack of light shines in from the ceiling illuminating a dusty disk. Once the disk is cleaned off it will reflect the light find the other disks and reflect the light onto the paper burning it and opening the door.

#### Mirror Mirror

- The party comes to a room with a large rectangular mirror at the end of it. In the mirror the party sees a large room. By stepping into the mirror they can explore the mirror realm, but when they turn to leave, the portal refuses to open. They're trapped in the mirror room. The trick here is to exit facing the same direction as they entered, by walking backwards through the portal.

#### 5.000 Candles

- 5,000 unlit candles in a large room and a tile with the number 1 inscribed on the floor by the doorways. Whichever of the several doors (including the exit) players walk through, they will find themselves in an identical room inscribed with the number 2. The next room will have the number 3, and so on. If they turn around and try to "go back" they find that the room now has the next number instead of the previous number. If players light a candle, that candle will still be lit in the next room. If, when a character walks through a door, the current room has a number of lit candles equal to the room number, the door functions as an exit to whatever is beyond the puzzle... The rooms are large enough that it takes about 10 minutes just to walk through. Keep track of time, exhaustion, rations, etc.

#### Hallucinogenic fungus

- The floors and walls are covered in a harmless but powerfully hallucinogenic fungus. Disturbing them releases their spores which will trigger a 2d6 hour trip. While tripping, players are easily disoriented, always surprised, and "succeed" at false perception checks. Wisdom checks to see if they can avoid bad trips. Repeated exposure makes the effects more extreme and the 2d6 hours start after exposure had stopped.

#### The Enchanted Poison

- There is a large bottle of deadly poison in the center of the room. Above the exit door is a carved face with an open mouth, pouring the poison into its mouth opens the door. However, if anyone touches the poison bottle, the face begins to chant a drinking song and whoever is touching the bottle is magically compelled to drink the poison. They remain compelled in this way until somebody pulls the bottle from them, at which point that person is affected by the compulsion instead.
