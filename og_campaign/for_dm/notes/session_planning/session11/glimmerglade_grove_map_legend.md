### Rooms
1. In the center of the room, there is a rectangular stone obelisk about 10ft wide. On one side of the obelisk, there is what appears to be a door, however it has no visible handle or locks. There are several figures carved into and around the door, all depicting portrayals humanoid figures. Several races are represented among the figures. **[** **DC 8 Perception/Investigation**: from left to right there are depictions of a halfling, an elf, a fairy, a dragonborn, a human, and a dwarf **]**. There are statues on either side of the obelisk; the statue on the left depicts an elven ranger with a bow and quiver slung across her back, arms spread wide in a friendly gesture. At the bottom is the enscriptopn "Aestar" (Strad recognizes this is Elvish for "together"). The statue on the right depicts a tall dragonborn barbarian wielding a two-handed axe, ready to swing downwards with a ferocious attack. The enscription at the bottom says "Re" in draconic (Vaaneth recognizes this as the Draconic word for "are" ).

2. **2 x Murky Myceloid**: As you enter the room, you notice there are black mushrooms growing all along the walls.... [trigger]  All at once, the room goes black except for a dim light eminating from the mushrooms which look like glowing eyes in the darkneass; their deep black color is constrasted by a yellow pulsing  bioluminescent glow... Roll a Strength save [DC 14 or become restrained] *There is darkness except for 10 ft radius of myceloids. After one dies, other casts moonbeam.* [2d10 radiant or half on DC14 con save]
      &nbsp;   
3. In the center of the room is a statue depicting an Aasimar. The Aasimar stands with serene grace, its celestial features carved in perfect harmony with radiant wings unfurled and a gentle, peaceful expression that conveys both divine beauty and  strength. **[DC 5 Perc/Invest ]** At the base of the statue there is a plaque which reads "Pounnem" ("Red" in Celestial).
   &nbsp;   
4. [Dragonchess club: Wit, name = Thaddius, color=blue] In this room, there are three warlock guards, two of whom are playing Dragonchess [Thaddius=Wit, Kalder= Deception, Draven=Insight ]. *This room is to give clues how to beat the Dragonchess tournament leading to room 10. It's like rock paper scissors [Wit<Decept<Insight<Wit].*  Thaddius (who isn't playing) explains:  
  > Dragonchess is a game of both skill and strategy. There are 3 dragoncchess clubs within our ranks, which each focusing on one type of strategy: Wit, Deception, and Insight. 
  > 
  > I'm in the Wit club. We follow a set of logical principles such as calculating the value of each piece and evaluating the immediate outcome of every potential move. The other clubs have different strategies, but this one is my favorite
  >
  >Would you like to play a game? 
5. [Dragonchess club: Deception, name=Kalder,color=black]
      >The Deception Club focuses on using tricky sacrifices to lure their opponent into a long term trap. This strategy is good against the wit club because calculating the piece values after a sacrifice tricks them into thinking they're winning they're really walking right into a trap. 
6. There is a statue which depicts a dwarf priest in long, flowing robes, with his arm raised and his head tilted back. However, the hand of the lifted arm is broken off and the dwarf looks at his missing hand, almost with a sense of longing.  **[DC 5,10 Perc/Inv]** The plaque at the bottom reads "Muol" ("key" in dwarvish). The statue's missing hand lies on the floor, holding a flaggon. 
     
- **[DC 11 Perc/Inv]** There are several (6) medium sized vanity mirrors hanging from the far wall. **[DC 15]** They aren't nearly as dusty as the rest of the walls. They are a relatively recent installment.
  - Investigation of the mirrors: When you look into the mirror, superimposed over your reflection you see a small room. Sitting inside is a silvery humanoid figure (silver surfer). 
  - If Vaaneth goes into the mirrorr, the silveriness dissapears and she sees an elf **[DC 12 Nature It's an Eladrin]**. This is someone from Strad's tree-top village. They are traumatized and so can't explain very clearly, but they remember that (each villager says something different)
  > There was a village meeting... the elder warned of tampering with magic items. Then a human with magic items came and... we were marching somewhere. I can't rememeber where or why... Next thing I knew I was in this room. Sounds like the elder was right. Why didn't we listen?
  >
  > Sometimes the man takes us out so we can help him. He needs fighters mostly.. I'm not the best at fighting... I was a cook in the village, so sometimes I get to cook. Usually human cuisine.. not my favorite cooking style..
  >
  > The tall human says we can stay outside if we change to human. Some of the others even took him up on it. Shameful! I said I'd rather be locked up! Now I'm starting to wonder if I made the right choice... 
  
7. In this room there is a pedistal, on top of which you see a scroll. Surrounding the scroll, there is a spherical bubble of energy. You see a mural painted on the walls of the room, though it appears dilapidated. There are several places where the wall has cracked and pieces of the mural are scattered haphazardly around the floor.  **[DC 10 Perc]** At the base of the pedistal, there is an inscription which says "Mend what is broken, whether body or soul. Only then can healing begin."  
   - Pictures on the wall:
     - A torn shirt
     - A chipped sword
     - A broken heart
   - Pieces on the floor
     - A needle and thread
     - An anvil and tongs
     - Two people holding hands
   - After placing the pieces in the correct location, the bubble powers down, revealing a **Scroll of Mending** 
      &nbsp;   
8. **[DC 17 Perc/Inv]** There is a crack in the wall indicating a hidden room. This secret door opens if you mend the drawf statue. Inside, there are piles of gold coins and gems (600 gold + Garnet, Pearl (white), Amythyst ). There is a pedistal with another scroll of mending. The mural on the wall shows someone crying. Underneath the sad figure, there is a picture of a chest overflowing with gold and treasure. 
      &nbsp;   
9.  In this room, there is a statue which depicts a cheerful, stout halfling standing with hands on his hips, wearing a simple tunic and boots. The plaque on the base reads "Lur" ("All" in Halfling)
  &nbsp;   
10.  At the far end of the room, there is a statue which portrays a majestic stag deer looking into the distance. **[DC 12 (resp. 5) Perc/Invest]** You notice that behind accompanied the deer's leg, there is  a small fairy smelling a flower. (resp.) The inscription at the bottom of the statue reads "Phe-remlit," which Strad recognizes as the Sylvan word for "We." 
  &nbsp;   
11.  [Dragonchess Club: Insight, name=Draven, color=yellow] the Insight Club focuses on reading their opponent to figure out what strategy they are using. This is very effective against the Deception club because we know not to fall for the traps. But it doesn't work against players in the Wit club becuase they always just follow the same logical principles regardless of what their opponent does. Want to join?
      &nbsp;   
12.  [Joint room with 11]
      &nbsp;   
13.  HexTail is playing Dragonchess with the Ethereal reaper (with black pieces). When he sees the party enter, he summons lots o' Skeley-bois and disappears. 
      &nbsp;   
14.  This small fairy garden, once filled with vibrant life, is now a dark, decaying space, consumed by necrotic energy. Withered flowers, blackened water, and a sickly green glow fill the room, replacing the garden's former magic.
      &nbsp;   
15.  This room is larger than the others you've seen so far. Although it mights imply be that the room *seems* larger because there is a floor to ceiling mirror on the wall, giving the illusion of twice as much space. Erected in the middle of the room, you see a statue of a female tiefling who eminates regal power. She has spiraling horns and a flowing cloak, her poised stance and coiled tail hinting at both beauty and deadly purpose. **[DC 5 Perc/Invest ]** At the base of the statue there is a plaque which reads "Myrrulq" ("Herring" in Infernal) [*Idea: Silver surfer men come up from the floor, but don't try to fight. They are actually villagers from Strad's hometown that are trapped in the mirror world trying to communicate. They can't talk or  hold their form for long. The elder shakes his head in disapproval at the crossbow*]
      &nbsp;   
16.  "Airlock" opening door  takes DC20 strength or DC10 if 2 people help. The next door can't be opened unless the previous door is closed (otherwise it shocks you 1d4+?). Varinn had these installed on either side of the Human room to insulate from the "imperfection of the other races. 
- Clue: **[DC ?? Perc/Invest ]**
- You find a discarded piece of parchment, which seems to be some kind of work order. It lists the price of materials (fur,  amber, rod of crystal, and a rod of glass) and number of hours of labor. At the bottom, there is a note which says "of all the grove's portrayals, the adjacent room's is a paragon of constitution and therefore must be insolated from the various malignities which persist throughout the grove. This mechanism's purpose is to keep the statue pristine. Payment will be made after I verify its efficacy"
          
&nbsp;   
17.   In the center of the room is a staue. It portrays a human bard sitting on a stool and strumming a lute; he wears a fancy cap with a feather in it and his mouth is open in song. **[DC 5 Perc/Invest ]** At the base of the statue there is a plaque which reads "The" in Common. **[DC 11 Perc/Invest ]** This staue seems to be in much better condition than the others. There aren't as many cracks, and it has a slight shine as if it has been recently polished. 
      &nbsp;   
18.   "Airlock" opening door from cooridor a takes DC20 strength or DC10 if 2 people help. The next door can't be opened unless the previous door is closed (otherwise it shocks you 1d4+?) Clue from `16` if they go this way first

e. This whole hallway leading to 10 (whichever way they end up coming from first) is like a pokemon gym, where you have to defeat a warlock in Dragonchess [Insight, Deception, Wit]. If you lose, you get teleported back to the start of the hallway. The 4th opponent (gym leader) cheats **[DC 15 Perc to notice]**. If you notice him cheating, he lets you past if you promise not to tell the others. Otherwise he attacks.
