# Session 7 Outline

### Main ideas:
- Nibbles tells about the Secret Society of Super Squirrels and how he enchanted the shoes
- Alyona communicates telepathically "WTF HAPPENED?"
- Nibbles teleports party to a place of their choosing

### More detailed
- Nibbles
  - tells full title (since Kebo-wan asked)
    > Full title is: Squeakian Thistlewood Acornspark Cleverwhisker XLII, Grand Magister of the Verdant Glade and Arborial Sanctum, Archmage of the Celestial Nutwood Conclave, Sovereign Protector of the Enchanted Oaklands, Keeper of the Ancient Acorn Mysteries, and High Sage of the Society of Super Squirrels, but you can just call me "Nibbles." 
  - tells about SSSS
  > "When I was younger, I practiced my enchantments without any regard for the consequences. Those shoes there are one example: I knew that they would be able to hold a powerful enchantment because of Derek's immense passion for dance fighting. You see, powerful magic can be extremely chaotic, but this chaos can be tethered by powerful emotions. Without the right emotions and experiences to ground them in reality, potent enchantments can make the user do things they wouldn't normally do. This chaos can vary in strength, ranging from relatively mild consequences to (such as dancing against your will or glowing inexplicably) to dire consequences (such as losing one's mind entirely)." 

  > "That's why I said I feel party responsible for tonight's events. I sensed that the shoes' enchantment had suddenly activated, and upon locating them I saw that you had been taken to that vault against your will. I'm sure you fine traveler's wouldn't have broken into a museum's vault and stolen precious artifacts if it hadn't been for those shoes putting you in that situation, right?"

  
    > Yes, yes. There can be a big difference between what you *want* to do with magic and what actually happens. Tell me about yourselves. What do **you** want to do? 
  - players go around and state their goals

  > "As I grew older, I realized that the consequences of my enchantments could be much worse than I originally intended, even if at first they were relatively minor. That's why I joined the Secret Society of Super Squirrels. We are a group of supremely powerful squirrels whose mission is to maintain balance in the realm while staying completely neutral and only getting involved if absolutely necessar--"
    
    At this point, Nibbles realizes that he has just got involved by teleporting the party out of the museum and explaining all of this stuff. He starts having a panic attack
    > Oh acorns! I'm doing it again aren't I? I've just gotten more ivolved by teleporting you here, darn it! Oh Nibbles, you nutterbutter. Sir Nutsalot always warns me about this! Think before you cast, think before you cast. Oh , furballs! What do I do now? What would Fiddletail do? I'll teleport you back: no wait, then you'll get arrested.. or worse. Plus, I just told you all that stuff about the society! What would Nutgar do? I suppose I could just kill you... No, that doesn't seem right either.. 

    >  [Optional] Okay here's an idea: I'll teleport you somewhere besides the museum, and we'll pretend this whole thing never happened. But you must promise not to tell Pawsworth. 
#### Don't forget:
- Alyona communicates again, asks to bring Jeremy back and maybe help over throw varrin
- Raven queen vision. Asks crow-vaaneth to pray to her
    > "Someone is using my darkness without my blessing. Necrotic energy flows out the Shadowfell and into your realm, corrupting all that it touches and tainting my legacy. I need a devoted follower to restore my name to its former glory. Use a raven's feather to make an altar. Midnight's prayer shall guide to way to restoring my legacy. " 
- Other entries of Varinn's diary
          - Death is imperfect, so all portals to the shadowfell must be closed. However, the power that lies there is immense. Perhaps there is a way to channel that energy toward the glory of Zarus...
          - The mirror realm turns out to be a surprisingly useful! Assets can be conveniently stored and easily accessed while heretics can be imprisoned without the need of guards
          - Alyona found out about the Carriers before I had a chance to ease her into it. She's being dramatic by running off into the woods, but I'm sure she'll come around eventually.  
- Possible encounter with Necrotic fairies
- Possible encounter with Timothias. Dont forget Trainters give -2 to hit +2 damage
- 
### Possible courses:
- Investigate Fairy, Dance, or Punch quest: 
    - take path NE to Enchanted Grove
    - Dance School and Tommy's Dojo/BBQ are on other side of Enchanted Grove
    - Go back to Owen's Outpost to challenge Timmy to a 1v1
- Investigate Shadowfell quests:
    - Read book about raven queen to find places where people know more about Raven queen
    - Varrin sealed off portal to Shadowfell since he considers death to be imperfect (maybe put somthing about this in the vault?)
    - Make alter to raven queen with the book (or feather?) and spend a short rest praying to her to unlock attunement
- Investigate Strad's Quest
    - Need to return to his home village or somehow learn about the prophecy
    - Entering Mirror Realm needs Invisibiliy/Blink/etc. to avoid running into yourr own reflection
- Returning to help Alyona
  - It will be a while to walk back to the Lodge. Encounter Shaman on the way back with hints about the other quests
  - Or find way to get there faster? Teleportation scrolls don't grow on trees
