Poem describing the Eyes of Zarus found in Archive of Auxiliary Attunement:

> In the time of ancient lore, where secrets dare not tread.
> There lie the Eyes of Zarus, with power widely spread.
> One is keen to distant sights, a watchful gaze that scries.
> While one can peer inside the mind, determine truth from lies.
>
> The Left Eye, in its silent might, sees far beyond the day,
> Through mists of time and distant lands, it charts the hidden way.
> The Right Eye, sharper than the blade, reads deep within the soul.
> Unveils the secrets, whispers soft, and makes the unknown whole.
>
> Yet with each use, a shadow falls, a veil upon the light.
> The vision dims, the darkness grows, a loss that grips the sight.
> Without the sacred ritual, it's sure to lead to blindness.
> The only ones who see the light are those who follow Zarus. 
> To bind oneself to greater power, and bear their mystic grace.
> One must embrace the Zarun creed and join their sacred race.
>
> The Left Eye, when attuned and true, unveils the distant scene.
> And grants the gift of silent speech where distant forms convene.
> Through realms of thought and spectral waves, you weave your whispered plea.
> With eye that spans the boundless night, you speak to those you see.
>
> The Right Eye, when its secrets known, commands the frozen will.
> To bind the foe in iron hold, where time itself stands still.
> A flicker of its magic's might can still the fiercest fighter.
> And turn a clash of wills to naught, a paralyzing nightmare.
>
> The Left Eye, in its fullest form, the charm of gods you wield.
> With every gaze, you bend the will, and make the heart’s true field.
> As for the Right Eye’s full extent, where souls and bodies switch.
> Exchanging even one's own mind, to alter fate’s deep stitch.
> 
> But those who seek their highest power must walk a path of dread.
> A sacrifice of one's own self for mystic arts ahead.
> The ritual is grim and stark, a harrowing embrace.
> To carve out part of who you are, to touch the great arcane.
> But in the end it's only fair, this is the will of Zarus.
> A trade of one eye for another, to sit upon the dais.
