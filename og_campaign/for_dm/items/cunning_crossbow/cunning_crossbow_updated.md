### Cunning Crossbow
*Light Crossbow, Artifact*

 &nbsp;&nbsp;![cunning_crossbow](https://i.imgur.com/7gECsLb.png) {width:250px,mix-blend-mode:multiply}

A sleek, silvery crossbow which is so smooth and glossy that it seems to be made of liquid metal, though it is cool to the touch and holds its shape like a solid.
:
*(Infusable)* Despite being magical, this item can be the target of `Magical Tinkering` and `Infuse Item`.
:
*(Arcane Ammunition)*  The magic imbued in this crossbow can infuse special properties into its ammunition. You have 2 charges of `Arcane Ammunition`, which replenish on a long rest. When making an attack with the Cunning Crossbow, you may spend charges of `Arcane Ammunition` to shoot one of the following arrows.

:
 None of these arrows inflict damage to their target, and their effect disappears after 1 hour or if another charge of `Arcance Ammunition` is used.
:
- `Rope Arrow`(1 charge) : A length of up to 80ft of rope is created from the tail of of this arrow as it flies. On a hit, the rope becomes magically fastened to its target. You can use a bonus action to retract the rope back into the arrow. 
- `Illuminating Arrow`(1 charge): Wherever this arrow lands, it magically transforms into a radiating ball of light, which sheds dim light in a 10 ft radius. You can use your bonus action to move the light up to 60 ft.  
- `Tracking Arrow` (2 charges): On a hit, this arrow begins tracking its target. The arrow then disappears and the target must make a DC 12 Wisdom save or else fail to notice being hit. You can use your bonus action to learn their current location, but doing so ends the arrow's effect. 
- `Spying Arrow`(2 charges): Wherever it lands, this invisible arrow starts taking in its surroundings, and you can use your bonus action to see as if you were at the arrow's location. You may return to seeing normally at will, but doing so ends the arrow's effect.

::
*(Attunement)* The blacksmith Thalia Ironhand poured the crossbow's liquid metal into different molds. This let the weapon take on different forms, although she couldn't get it to keep one shape or another. However, you've spent time getting to know the fickle nature of this crossbow, and it seems to hold its shape a little better when you're wielding it. 
:
Once per short rest, you can use an action to change the Cunning Crossbow into either of the following forms:
:
`Brutal Ballista` (heavy crossbow, 1d10)
 
  Your number of `Arcane Ammunition` charges is set to 10. In addition, you can use the following enchanted arrows:
  - `Empowered Arrow`(1 charge) If this arrow hits, it does an additional 1d4 force damage. 
  - `Inertial Arrow`(2 charges) If this arrow hits, the target must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or else be pushed back 15 ft.  
  - `Skewering Arrow`(3 charges) If this arrow hits, it passes through the target and continues flying in a straight line for up to 400ft. If another target is in the line of fire, you may roll to hit again and repeat this process (rolls to hit on targets 101-400ft away still have disadvantage).
  - `Teleporting Arrow` (5 charges) You instantly teleport to wherever the arrow lands (doesn't provoke opportunity attacks)

:
 `Twin Triggers` (*2 hand crossbows*, 1d6 each)
 
 You can use a bonus action to attack with the crossbow in your off hand (you do not add your Dex to damage rolls made with the off-hand crossbow). In addition, your number of `Arcane Ammunition` charges is set to 6 and you gain the following arrows:
 - `Guiding Arrow` (1 charge) If this arrow hits, the next attack roll made against the target has advantage.
 - `Reflecting Arrow` (3 charges) If this arrow hits, it deals 1d6 bonus damage and then bounces off towards a random enemy within 30ft. Each time the arrow reflects, it does 3/4 of its previous damage (rounded to the nearest integer). 
 - `Portal Arrows` (5 charges and Concentration) The crossbows' magical energies are intertwined with each other. Firing the main hand weapon marks a spot, and firing the off-hand weapon opens a portal connecting to that spot for up to 1 minute (similar to the Arcane Gate spell).
