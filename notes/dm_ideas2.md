##### session 2 ideas
*Main idea: Alyona wants to recruit the party to her side to help get her body back. She transforms into a doe to watch the party on their way to lodge and help/hinder their actions*
- The guards reported the theif went west int the woods. The only things nearby in that direction are
  - Zaridel Mine
  - old abandonded hunting lodge called **Lucky Deer Lodge**
- Varinn emphasizes that haste is important to retrieve the Left Eye of Zarus,
  but feel free to stop by the merchant if there's anything you need for the quest before heading out
-   Upon leaving town, Alyona uses the Eye to telepathically say:
  > Don't try to stop me; There is more at play here than you know. I can explain everything.
  > Varinn is not who he seems.
- At Zaridel mine
  - there are non-human workers slaving away dutifully (mining, choping wood, etc.)
  - There is talk about how Zarus hasn't answered their prayers yet today, but their faith remains strong
  - The workers haven't seen anyone come by.
  - One guy thought he heard someone running, but unpon further inspection it turned out to just be a deer
