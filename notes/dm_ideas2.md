##### session 2 ideas
*Main idea: Alyona wants to recruit the party to her side to help get her body back. She transforms into a doe to watch the party on their way to lodge and help/hinder their actions*
- The guards reported the theif went west int the woods. The only things nearby in that direction are
  - Zaridel Mine
  - old abandonded hunting lodge called **Lucky Deer Lodge**
- Varinn emphasizes that haste is important to retrieve the Left Eye of Zarus,
  but feel free to stop by the merchant if there's anything you need for the quest before heading out
- In shop, there will be
    - common armor/weapons (see players handbook)
    - potion of animal friendship (~20 gp depending on charisma check)
    - potion of healing (~20 gp
    - scroll of knock (~15 gp, must ask shopkeeper to see special items DC 7 persuasion)
-   Upon leaving town, Alyona uses the Eye to telepathically say:
  > Don't try to stop me; There is more at play here than you know. I can explain everything.
  > Varinn is not who he seems.
- At Zaridel mine
  - there are non-human workers slaving away dutifully (mining, choping wood, etc.)
  - There is talk about how Zarus hasn't answered their prayers yet today, but their faith remains strong
  - The workers haven't seen anyone come by.
  - One guy thought he heard someone running, but unpon further inspection it turned out to just be a deer

- Alyona has used Plant Growth to enrich the land around the cabin in order to survive.
  Plants are overgrown within 1/2 mile of cabin and there are some plants that typically wouldn't be able
  to survive in the forest such as tropical flowers and thick vines
- Upon entering this enriched area there is

  **Encounter** (*see images folder for monster's character sheets*)
  - 2 wolves CR 1/4
  - 2 ranged squirrels CR 1/8
  - 2 melee squirrels CR 1/8
    
    *Alyona watches while under the effects of pass without trace\.*
    *She will help the players if they get too close to dying*

    *If the players spot her, she will use Wild Shape to turn into a Doe*

- If the players make it to the Lodge, the door will be locked and they must figure out a way inside:
    - The windows can be broken with a DC 14 strength check (this will make Alyona mad at you)
    - Can use Scroll of Knock purchased at shop (this will make Alyona mad at you)
    - Thieves Tools to pick lock : DC 14 Sleight of hand (this will make Alyona mad at you)
    - Somehow let Alyona know you want to help her and she'll reveal self
    - If players try to get in, Alyona will telepathically talk to them to see their intentions
- If players want to help Alyona,
  - she'll tell her backstory and explain about how Varinn has her body
  - explain that she doesn't fully undersand how the orbs work and needs to research them at Lavendar Library
- If players want to help Varinn,
  - they'll have to get the Left Eye of Zarus from Alyona's person
  - Alyona warns that she doesn't want to hurt them, but she'll fight back if necessary
  - If players decide to fight Alyona, set her level down to 2 or 3 so that TPK isn't *totally* inevitable
