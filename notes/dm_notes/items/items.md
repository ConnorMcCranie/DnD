*(Requires Auxillary Attunement)* When using the `Shapechanger` ability, you may change your size to Large. In addition, once per long rest you may shapechange into "The Empty Shape," which is the lack of an appearance altogether. Doing so gives you and your `Raven Familiar` the `Invisibility` trait, which is lost upon taking damage, attacking, casting a spell, or at will.

### Timmy's Tenderizers
*Wonderous Item, Legendary*
:
A pair of brass knuckles featuring a grid of small pointed spikes, resembling the face of a meat tenderizing mallet. Used by the renown fighter Timothias the Tenatious during the Battle of Hayrun.
:
*(Tenderize)* Your unarmed attacks apply the `Tenderized` de-buff, which lasts for 10 seconds. Each additional unarmed attack you land on a `Tenderized` creature deals +1 bludgeoning damage and refreshes the duration of `Tenderized`. 

*(Requires Attunement)* The `Tenderized` efffect now stacks up to 5 times. A creature with 5 stacks of `Tenderized` becomes `Fully Tender`, at which point the bonus damage is increased to +2 and the number required to crit is reduced by 2. 
:
*(Requires Auxillary Attunement)* Your unaramed attacks ignore resistance to bludgeoning damage and deal half damage against immunity to bludgeoning damage. The `Tenderized` effect now stacks any number of times and at 10 stacks becomes `Falling Off The Bone`, at which point the bonus damage is equal to your level. Each additional stack beyond 10 increases the bonus damage by 1 and decreases the number required to crit by 1 (minimum 2).
