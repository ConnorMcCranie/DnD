*(Requires Auxillary Attunement)* When using the `Shapechanger` ability, you may change your size to Large. In addition, once per long rest you may shapechange into "The Empty Shape," which is the lack of an appearance altogether. Doing so gives you and your `Raven Familiar` the `Invisibility` trait, which is lost upon taking damage, attacking, casting a spell, or at will.
