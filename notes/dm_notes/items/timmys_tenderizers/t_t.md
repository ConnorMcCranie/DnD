### Timmy's Tenderizers
*Wonderous Item, Legendary*
:
A pair of brass knuckles featuring a grid of small pointed spikes, resembling the face of a meat tenderizing mallet. Used by the renown fighter Timothias the Tenatious during the Battle of Hærūn.
:
*(Tenderize)* Your unarmed attacks apply the `Tenderized` de-buff, which lasts for 10 seconds. Each additional unarmed attack you land on a `Tenderized` creature deals +1 bludgeoning damage and refreshes the duration of `Tenderized`. 

*(Requires Attunement)* The `Tenderized` efffect now stacks up to 5 times. A creature with 5 stacks of `Tenderized` becomes `Fully Tender`, at which point the bonus damage is increased to +2 and the number required to crit is reduced by 2. 
:
*(Requires Auxillary Attunement)* Your unaramed attacks ignore resistance to bludgeoning damage and deal half damage against immunity to bludgeoning damage. The `Tenderized` effect now stacks any number of times and at 10 stacks becomes `Falling Off The Bone`, at which point the bonus damage is equal to your level. Each additional stack beyond 10 increases the bonus damage by 1 and decreases the number required to crit by 1 (minimum 2).
