**clue for players:** 
> In realms where magic weaves its strand,
> A corset binds both tight and grand.
> If change you seek without attuning,
> It clasps you fast, slim chance removing.
>
> At midnight’s toll, a test unfolds,
A trial of wisdom, fate beholds.
If failed, you’ll shift and take the wing,
While raven’s antics you’ll now bring.

### Attunement
- To attune to the corset, you must make an alter to the [Raven Queen](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Raven_Queen) at midnight  using the `Raven Queen's Feather` (she didn't have a physical body, but rather the feather belonged to her favorite raven named Midnight). The `Raven Queen's Feather` can be found at the Mystic Museum. 
- With this level of attunement, the Wisdom DC to swap bodies with the Raven at midnight is reduced to 10. 
  
**clue for players:** 
>Attunement, you must now take heed,
An altar made from Midnight’s wing.
The Raven's Queen most precious feather,
Will bind your fate with magic’s tether.


### Auxillary Attunement
- To obtain Auxillary Attunement, you must sign the *`Corvine Contract`* using a quill made of the `Raven Queen's Feather`.
- The `Corvine Contract` can be found at the the `Fortress of Memories` in Shadowfell.
- There is no Wisdom saving throw at midnight anymore and you automatically succeed the Int saving throw when using Contact Other Plane to contact the Raven Queen.
    
**clue for players:** 
To gain the most from corset's grace,
You'll sign the contract, find your place.
A quill from Raven’s feather made,
Ensures your magic’s never swayed.

In Shadowfell, a fortress deep,
Her memory you must not weep.
There lies the contract’s secret power,
Atop the highest, darkest tower.
