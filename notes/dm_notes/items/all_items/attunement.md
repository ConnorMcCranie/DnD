# Corvine Corset Attunement
### Without attunement
- If you shapechange without being attuned, the corset becomes attatched to you, becoming impossible to remove except by casting Remove Curse.
- If the corset is attachedd to you at midnight, you must roll a DC20 Wisdom saving throw. On a fail, your consciousness switches with that of the Raven Familiar in the [Shadowfell](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowfell) for 10 minutes. 
  
  
<!--- 
originally made which plane you go to random, but changed it to Shadowfell

Roll 2d4 (in order) to determine which plane you see through raven's eyes (see the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Plane#List_of_planes) for description): 
  |̅1̅st̅\ <u>2nd</u> | 1 | 2 |  3| 4 |
  |:-: |:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
  | 1 | Mount Celestia | Bytopia | Elysium | Beastlands |
  | 2 | Arborea | Ysgard | Limbo | Pandemonium |
  | 3 | Abyss | Carceri | Hades | Gehenna |
  | 4 | Nine Hells of Baator | Acheron | Mechanus | Arcadia |

- Meanwhile, the raven causes your body to flap your arms, squak, and peck at the ground for bugs etc.

### Attunement
- To attune to the corset, you must make an alter to the [Raven Queen](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Raven_Queen) at midnight  using the `Raven Queen's Feather` (she didn't have a physical body, but rather the feather belonged to her favorite raven named Midnight). The `Raven Queen's Feather` can be found at the Mystic Museum. 
- With this level of attunement, the Wisdom DC to swap bodies with the Raven at midnight is reduced to 10. 

### Auxillary Attunement
- To obtain Auxillary Attunement, you must sign the *`Corvine Contract`* using a quill made of the `Raven Queen's Feather`.
- The `Corvine Contract` can be found at the the `Fortress of Memories` in Shadowfell.
- There is no Wisdom saving throw at midnight anymore and you automatically succeed the Int saving throw when using Contact Other Plane to contact the Raven Queen.
