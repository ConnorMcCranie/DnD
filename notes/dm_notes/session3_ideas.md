### Outline
1. Meet with Alyona in lodge where she:
   - explains her backstory
   - says she doesn't fully understand how the Left Eye of Zarus works or why the animals attacked (Prarie dog tells her that they gave him honey)
   - asks for help: Go to **Lavendar Library** and find the **Archive of Auxilary Attunement** to find out how to fully attune 
   - Casts pass without trace on them (?)
2. After leaving the lodge, they come across 3 Zarunites (Malakai, Mikah, Magnus):
   - they are on their way to the **Mystic Museum** to return the **Corvine Corset**
   - They are talking about how the Corvine Corset was supposed to be a reward for returning the Eye, but the false heros betrayed the town by siding with Alyona
    - The shirt was supposed to be brought by the previous group carrying the other 3 rewards, but it mysteriously disappeared only to later be found in the exact same place 
    - They will fight the party upon recognizing them and the Corvine Corset can be looted 
3.  Party continuously feels like they are being watched because Varinn has spies in the bodies of small forest animals watching everything
4. On the way to the Library/Museum is a small town: **Owen's Outpost** (pop ~ 30)

   - Consists of 'reject' ex-Zarunites. There are 3 types: 
     - non-humans (mostly half-orcs, tiefling with a few Tabaxi and half-elf) who wanted to live in Zaridel but not deemed worthy of a human body
     - former humans who got put in non-human bodies for someone else whose mind was deemed 'superior.'
     - humans who became disillusioned and escaped (mostly women who escaped the breeeding farms)
   - Small amount of town folk want to get revenge on Varinn, but most see this as impossible and just want to move on with their lives
   - Party needs to find get the map to Lavander Library/Mystic Museum. 
     - if they try to go without it, there will be forks in the road and various traps
     - most people don't know much other than the fact that Zarunites sometimes pass through the Outpost on their way to do errands for Varrin
     - there is one hermit Tiefling **Kai Shadowthorn** who has been to the Mystic Museum
       - He wanted to get something as powerful as the Eyes of Zarus to get revenge on Varrin for looking down on Tieflings
       - Obtained the **Nevermore Necklace** , which puts the wearer under the effect of *Foresight.* However, without being fully attuned it also gives the wearer perpetual short-term memory loss, being cursed to constantly see the future and immediately forget it. 
       - Kai has gone mad: has dramatic mood swings when new visions occur, never sure if it's real or a dream, like Memento. Doesn't even remember that the necklace is what's causing it, but will fiercely oppose any attempt tto remove it
     - Kai thinks that his mind will be clearer if he casts Haste and can be persuasded to give the map in exchange for Licorice root.
