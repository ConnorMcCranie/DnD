### Outline
1. Meet with Alyona in lodge where she:
   - explains her backstory
   - says she doesn't fully understand how the Left Eye of Zarus works or why the animals attacked (Prarie dog tells her that they gave him honey)
   - asks for help: Go to Lavendar Library and find the Archive of Auxilary Attunement to find out how to fully attune 
   - Casts pass without trace on them (?)
2. After leaving the lodge, they come across 3 Zarunites:
   - they are on their way to the Mystic Museum to return the Shifting Shirt
   - They are talking about how the Shifting Shirt was supposed to be a reward for returning the Eye, but the false heros betrayed the town by siding with Alyona
    - The shirt was supposed to be brought by the previous group carrying the other 3 rewards, but it mysteriously disappeared only to later be found in the exact same place 
    - They will fight the party upon recognizing them and the Shifting Shirt can be looted
