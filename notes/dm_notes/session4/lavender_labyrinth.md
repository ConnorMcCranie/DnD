# Lavender Labyrinth 
Players encounter a magical labyrinth at the end of the Mountain Pass. Upon entering, they find themselves in a hedge maze made of magical lavender bushes; any attempt to go above the bushes or otherwise cheat the the puzzle is impossible. At each junction, there are three possible directions: left, right or to return backwards. To determine the correct path, each junction has a number, whose remainder after division by three tells which way to go: 0 = left, 1 = right, 2 = backwards. 

There are 3 "rounds," where round N consists of choosing N correct directions in a row. If they choose incorrectly, the last choice of the round falls into an underground tunnel (filled with skeletons of previous adventurers who perished trying to solve the maze for flair). In the underground area, there will be one torch lit for each mistake made in that round. Climbing up tthe ladder will start from the beginning, and the correct path is reset randomly. On the floor, there is a large roman numeral I, II, or III to indicate which round they're in. To help them, there is the following hint:
> Divide among your choice of paths,
> And only what remains can help you.
> With nothing left, one does what's right.
> That's what this number tries to tell you. 
>
> To demonstrate sufficient knowledge,
> First once, then twice, then thrice you'll choose.
> But every failure leads to fire,
> From fire you must start anew.

If still stuck, give them additional clue:
> Determining one's choice of paths,
> Indeed depends on state of mind.
> So quick we see the paths before us,
> Neglecting those which lie behind.
