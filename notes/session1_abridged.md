#### Session 1

- Players are travelling in a carriage toward Zaridel when a hitchhiker named Alyona joins them. She says that something important to her was stolen by Varinn and that she intends to get it back. 
- Upon arriving to Zaridel, the party is greeted by Brother Marth, who recognizes Alyona. Immediately, Alyona rushes out of the carriage at super-human speed without explanation 

- Brother Marth guides the party into a large cathedral in the center of Zaridel. 
- The party watches a ballet, and Thalor participates. 
- Vaaneth notices that all the townspeople are humans and look similar to one another. She changes her appearance to match that the crowd, and they respond by saying that she looks much more perfect than before. 
  - They are surprised not by the mere fact that she changed into a human, but rather by how *sudden* the change was and say 
    > "You have increased your perfection much faster than anyone before. You must be chosen by Zarus! He has blessed our town by sending you to us."

- Varinn changes the subject by saying there is now going to be a feast in the dining hall and Varinn invites them to his table.
-  Alarm bells start ringing and Brother Marth runs up to Varinn and says "There is an emergency! The Left Eye of Zarus has been stolen!" 
-  Varinn says he knows who must have stolen it and asks the party to help retrieve it in return for a reward. 
-  The party agrees to help and Varinn offers to let them stay in a tavern for free. The party lodges at the luxurious tavern for the night.
