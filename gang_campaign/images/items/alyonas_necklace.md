This silver chain holds a single, intricately detailed leaf pendant, characteristic of elven jewelry from the Gallant Grasslands. It has been passed down through Elvish families for generations. The charm hums with a faint, residual magic from the region, which gives the wearer a heightened connection with the Fey.

*(Fey Heirloom)* If you fail a Wisdom saving throw to resist being charmed or frightened, you may make the roll again and take the result. This effect can be used once per short rest.
