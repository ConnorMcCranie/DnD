# Session 6
**Recap**
- Horace the Horse
- Got to Verdant Refuge
- Got way too many powders from Charles the Alchemist
- Got fancy clothes for the wake and planned a heist
- Met Thalia the Ironforge and got sword blade infused with pixie dust

**Lore**
- Morgan Sr. has high expectations of his necromancer family: sorta addams family coded
    - he died 10 years ago, but the family consistently casts speak with dead on his corpse to communicate with him as if he is still part of the family
- Morgan Jr. 
  - tries to live up to the spooky vibe expected of 
- The Divine council Warlock betrayed the others and helped Marwinn
  - is now a squirrel with black hair
- Marsha is mother and is chhangeling. Still alive but very old and senile

**Ideas**

- Go to the wake
  - Morgan and Varinn are there: they give vague hints about using kaysa to resurrect Morgana
  - Cast Speak with Dead on Morgana, but her throat is shot through and she can't speak
    - motivates full resurrection using kaysa
- Marsha wants the corset back, says it's important for relationship with Raven Queen, but too senile to adequately explain details 
- There is a puzzle in the mansion which unlocks Morgan Jr.'s secret room devoted to his guilty pleasure of Glimmer G-pop (dnd equivalent of kawaii jpop)

**Puzzles**
1.  5 lever puzzle
  > A primary first helps open the door
  The second lever will sound like a roar
  The last lever pulled is the color of sky
  After the second will buzz like a fly.
  - color:sounds = black:roar,yellow:buzz,blue:flute,green:wind,red:bell
  - correct answer red,black,yellow,green, blue
  - correct order opens a compartment with triangle lock key 
  > key engraving = "Five fr om the right"
1. Mirror Puzzle
  - One room has a giant mirror taking up the whole wall
  - Some things are different in the reflection:
    - Chair out of place
    - key on fireplace mantle
    - cloak hanging on coat rack can be found in closet in nearby room or worn by wake attendants
    - necromancy book is on side table next to chair: book is on the table in front of Morgan's corpse at the  main ceremony
  - locating/placing all 3 objects in right spot causes key to appear on fireplace mantle 
    > key says "Five from the left"
2.  Key Puzzle
  - There is an ornate metal doorway with triangular array of keyholes of size 15.
    > above door says `DARK MAGIC RITUAL ROOM: AUTHORIZED NECROMANCERS ONLY`
    >
    > clue below bottom row of keyholes says "3 in between" 
  - Need to obtain the two keys and place in correct slots 
    - 5th row, keyholes 1 & 5
    - 13th row, keyholes 5 & 9
  - solving one row makes something click into place and the keyholes light up green
  - solving both rows makes the triangle part in half and open to reveal spooky corridor
    - ominous runes carved into wall with blood, torture devices strewn about, skeletons, etc. At the end of hall is simple wooden door which says 
    > `CHAMBER OF ETERNAL SCREAMING - DO NOT ENTER OR YOUR SOUL WILL MELT`
    - The room is devoted to Morgan Jr.'s secret obsession: Glimmer G(nome)-Pop
    - Inside there is pulsating blue and pink lights like a rave, with a discoball and the sound of G-pop music playing. There is countless G-pop paraphenalia  
      - The posters feature "The Gumdrops" an all-female G-Pop group consisting of three Forest Gnomes and a Rock Gnome drummer. They have enormous, magically enlarged eyes and brightly dyed hair.
      - There are life size cutouts of Kira, Bop, and Lulu (the group Glitter Morning)
      - Song: Cast Your Heart (at 9th level)
