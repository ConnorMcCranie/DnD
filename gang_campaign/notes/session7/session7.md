### Last Time

## Ideas
- Converse with Morgan, G-PoP item ??
  - He says that to get to Kaysa will require fighting through difficult enemies
- Whiskey is almost out of cigarettes but Joe Camel has a magically refilling pack
- Encounter group of Tortles (Shellsworn) being attacked by monsters (Necrotic fairies, undead, etc.)
  - Tortles are Ploby, Jera, and Krunnir
- After saving them, they tell of the glimmeroot caverns being overrun and Koba sending more members to take action on the surface
- Magical darkness is the Evil warlock squirrel's hideout. It moves around: like an RV
