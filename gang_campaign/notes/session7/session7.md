## Ideas
- Converse with Morgan, G-PoP item ??
- Whiskey is almost out of cigarettes but Joe Camel has a magically refilling pack
- Encounter group of Tortles (Shellsworn) being attacked by monsters
  - Necrotic fairies, undead, etc.
- After saving them, they tell of the glimmeroot caverns being overrun and Koba sending more members to take action on the surface
- Magical darkness is the Evil warlock squirrel's hideout. It moves around: like an RV
