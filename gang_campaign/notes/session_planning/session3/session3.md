### Main Ideas
- Deal with Morgana's body
- Silas the Silent follows the party on the way back to owen's outpost
- reuinion with alyona and her parents
- mcguffin to go to library and grasslands
- puzzles (Library Labrynth )

&nbsp;------**Owens Outpost**---------- 
> The familiar, unadorned buildings of Owen's Outpost are a welcome sight after the ambush. You guide Alyona to the town's tavern, where you find her parents arguing
>Alan `For the last time Lianes, you shant leave town until we get word about Alyona.`
> Lianes `I don't see what the big deal is, Alan. I've been dying to see the new exhibit at the museum, and it's only a few days journey each way. I'll be back before you know it.`
> Alan `For the last bloody time, I don't care if the Emporer of Ferundia is an hour outside town, you're not leaving until we find out about our daughter. `
>
> Just then, they look up to see you have returned. `So? Were you able to find Alyona?`
>` "Is... is that really you? Your face... your ears... what did they do to you?"`

**Reuinion** [Address the fact that Alyona is now human]
- Alyona wants to get her original body back, but not sure how. 
  > I have no idea how the orb works. Even if I did, I doubt Varinn would willingly hand it over, and stealing it would be suicide.
  - Suggest that maybe they could figure out what the orbs are and how they work at the Lavendar Library
- > Years ago when I first visited Zaridel, the "ceremonies" were much less frequent. Varinn starting taking regular journeys to the library, and after that more and more of the ceremonies started incorporating that bowl of metal liquid, what he calls the `Blood of Zarus`. Then they were happening all the time, sometimes daily. Whatever Varinn's true motive, that strange metal seems to be accelerating it. We need to know what we're dealing with if we hope to reverse the process. 

**Lori**
- A tall elf with the keen eyes and practical leather armor of a warden approaches your table. She carries a bow and quiver on her back. She introduces herself as Lori Faewood, Warden of the Verdant Refuge in the Gallant Grasslands.

>"I'm sorry to interrupt, but I've come seeking help," she says, her voice strained with urgency. "I'm Lori Faewood, Warden of the Verdant Refuge. The Gallant Grasslands are dying. The fey music has fallen silent, and a creeping, black blight poisons the hills. Kaysa, the ancient fairy whose magic sustains the region, has vanished without a trace. Without Kaysa's magic to protect us, a dreadful pack of warlocks have taken over the land. 

>"My rangers are spread thin. I need a small, capable group to travel to the heart of the problem—Glimmerglade Grove—and find out what has happened to Kaysa. If her light is gone for good, the Grasslands will fall into shadow completely.""


&nbsp;------**Toward Library/Grasslands**---------- 
- At the entrance to the Mountain Pass is a teleportation circle which says "Lavender Library Member Entrance", and a sign next to the cave entrance says "Apply For New Library Card"
- Inside the cave there is a puzzle on each floor
1.  **The "One Way" Hall**  
       - A Hallway that looks normal but ends in a dead end. When you turn around there is a wall 5 ft behind you. You are now stuck. The wall appears solid. On the end wall there is writing saying "keep your eye here and you may escape." 
       - The player has to look at the writing and walk backwards to escape the hallway.
       - doing this walks backward in the magic elevator taking them to next floor


2. **Metal Copy Cat**
    - The party enters a room that looks like a metal forge, with scrap metal, a furnace, etc. In the center is a large anvil that reads "The key is found within your head, use the key to paint me red. But be aware of what you spurn, for what you give shall be returned."
    - They have to put blood on the anvil, at which point the furnace will glow and the tools will magically create a metal copy of whoevers blood it was. This copy has the same stats except +10 HP, 18AC, Resistance to Bludgeoning, Vulnerable to Lightning.
    - After defeating it, the door will open and a magic elevator will take them to the next floor. 


3. **Narcisist's Puzzle** [Maybe Skip this one since Vaaneth can cheat]
   - Enter a room filled with chest(s) slightly cluttered with objects/clothing. There is a statue staring into a mirror with a slight smile on their face. As you approach the statue it looks up and says "Only the most beautiful may pass"  and then looks back into the mirror.

   - In the chests, or around the room there are various articles of clothing. Some of those articles of clothing are the same as the articles of clothing that the statue is wearing. Once one of the party members wears a matching set of clothing to the statue (the statue will comment on your sense of style/beauty) will the door appear.

   - If they approach not wearing matching articles of clothes the statue sneers and says "why would I let someone so hideous pass" and have the statue summon some sort of monster.

   - Bonus Item: If, in addition to the players changing into the same set of clothing, they use some sort of illusion spell to mimic the statues face, the statue gushes over there beauty and awards them with a Narcissist's Blessing: +2 Charisma until long rest. 

    - If players have trouble figuring out the puzzle either have the statue go on and on about themselves, or leave clues such as a journal showering themselves with praise.
    
4. **101 Candles**
   - 100 unlit candles with 1 lit candle in a large room and a tile with the number 1 inscribed on the floor by the doorways. There is a torch and a bucket of water as well.
   -  Whichever of the several doors (including the exit) players walk through, they will find themselves in an identical room inscribed with the number 2. The next room will have the number 3, and so on.  If they turn around and try to "go back" they find that the room now has the next number instead of the previous number. If players light a candle, that candle will still be lit in the next room. 
   - If, when a character walks through a door, the current room has a number of lit candles equal to the *next* room number, the door goes to the elevator.
   - If players get stuck, have there be a hint "A wise adventurer looks not where they've been, but where they're going"



5. **Lavender Labyrinth**

Players come to a magical labyrinth at the end of the Mountain Pass. Upon entering, they find themselves in a hedge maze made of magical lavender bushes; any attempt to go above the bushes or otherwise cheat the the puzzle is impossible. 

Moreover, there is a group of 5 Zarunites (2 lvl2 and 3 lvl1) arguing about how they've spent the whole day at this part and usually Zarus guides their paths. They are carrying total of 60gp and the chest of reward items
- At each junction, there are three possible directions: left, right or to return backwards. To determine the correct path, each junction has a number, whose remainder after division by three tells which way to go: 0 = left, 1 = right, 2 = backwards. 

- There are 3 "rounds," where round N consists of choosing N correct directions in a row. If they choose incorrectly, the last choice of the round falls into an underground tunnel (filled with skeletons of previous adventurers who perished trying to solve the maze for flair). In the underground area, there will be one torch lit for each mistake made in that round. Climbing up tthe ladder will start from the beginning, and the correct path is reset randomly. On the floor, there is a large roman numeral I, II, or III to indicate which round they're in. To help them, there is the following hint:
> Divide among your choice of paths,
> And only what remains can help you.
> With nothing left, one does what's right.
> That's what this number tries to tell you. 
>
> To demonstrate sufficient knowledge,
> First once, then twice, then thrice you'll choose.
> But every failure leads to fire,
> From fire you must start anew. 

|Attempt \#| Correct Path | Clue |
| :--------: | :------------: | :----: |
| 1 | L <br> R , R <br> R , R ,  B | 0  <br>  19,  31  <br>  7,  55,  26 |
| 2 | L  <br> L , R  <br>  R , L , B | 420 <br> 36 , 13 <br> 67 , 69 , 41 |
| 3 | R <br> R , L <br> L , R , B | 25 <br> 43 , 9 <br> 18 , 61 , 32 |
| 4 | L <br> L , R  <br> L , L , B | 3 <br> 69 , 10 <br> 15 , 21 , 26 |

If still stuck, give them additional clue:
> Determining one's choice of paths,
> Indeed depends on state of mind.
> So quick we see the paths before us,
> Neglecting those which lie behind.

&nbsp;

Once they make it to the end, they find themselves in the Lavender Library Lobby, where they are greeted by Ralnor the Elf, who prints out their library cards.
