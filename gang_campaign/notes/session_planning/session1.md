### Session 1
- Party starts in Owen's outpost. 
  - NPC's present: Alyona's Parents (Lianes and Alan), Lori Faewood(?), Timothias, Jeremey(?)
- Lianes enters the tavern(?) and exclaims 
 >"There you are Alan! I just got back from my stroll and was looking for you and Alyona. Are you feeling alright? You look a little different." 
 >He looks back in shock and eventually says "... got back from your stroll.. GOT BACK FROM YOUR STROLL?? Lianes, YOU'VE BEEN GONE FOR FOURTEEN YEARS!"
 "Oh, was it 14? How time flies! Sorry about that. I was having such a nice walk through the forest and got a little distracted by the cutest little squirrels. Then I went to the Library for a couple years and then back to the Gallant Grasslands. That place has really fallen out of grace since I grep up-- "
 "You abandoned us! We thought you were dead!"
 "Oh don't be so dramatic, it was just a few years. I would've let you know if I was going to be gone for more than a quarter century."
 "Maybe 14 years is 'just a few' for you, but it's quite a bit more than that for the rest of us. My mother warned me about marrying an elf, but I didn't listen... She's dead now, by the way. Too bad you couldn't make it to the funeral" 
 "Oh, is that why you look so different? I guess I forgot that humans live for a few less centuries than elves do. Anyways, where's Alyona?"
 "Alyona's gone. She didn't exactly react well to her mother abandoning her out of the blue. She renounced her elvish heritage and left for Zaridel. Can't say I blame her."
 "Well I should very much like to see her."
 "I'm not sure she feels the same way about you. Besides, once someone moves to Zaridel, they rarely ever want to leave. I doubt we'll ever see her again. 

If party offers to help, the family pleads to give Alyona a childhood memento of her mother in hopes that she will return.

- (Lori chimes in about how things aren't right in the Gallant Grasslands and moreover that Varinn is trying to obtain a monopoly on Sorcerer's Silver.)?
- Upon getting to Zaridel, citizens act weird when asked about Alyona.
    > You mean Lynn? You've come just in time! Today's the Festival of Perfect Unity and she's the guest of honor at Purification Ceremony
