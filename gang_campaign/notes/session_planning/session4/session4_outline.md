### Details
-----**Final Puzzle: Trial of Spirit**--------
  - Sort of like Suffering Game: Forgive/Forsake
  > You find yourselves standing atop a teleportation circle in the center of a rectangular stone room. About 60 feet in front of you, you see two wooden doors. Moments after appearing in the room, the doors begin to light up and a swirl of magical energy coalesces into an etherial figure. The amorphous transluscent energy settles into form of an old man with a long jagged beard wearing wizard's robes. The man's mouth doesn't move, but you hear a voice speak telepathically:
  `Greetings, Lavender Library Applicants! To have made it this far, you have proven yourselves worthy of mind and of body. Now before you lies a choice. This trial is not for yourselves alone, but also for those who journey alongside you in this labyrinth.`
  > The ghostly figure gestures to the wall on your right, which suddenly starts to become transparent, revealing an adjacent room. This adjacent room appears to be identical to the one in which you stand, featuring a pair doors at one end. In front of those doors, an identical spectral wizard is gesturing toward the corresponding teleportation circle, upon which stands a group of 4 humanoid creatures: an enormous goliath wielding a whip, a rugged-looking monk wearing brass knuckles, a human woman wearing Zarunite garb, and a 3ft tall hovering pink fairy all stare back at you.
  `Observe your counterparts. They face the same decision: COMPASSION or SELF-PRESERVATION.`
  > The spectral wizard flicks his wrist and a quill magically appears, whereupon it hastily etches the words compassion and self-preservation into the stone above each door.  
  `Your group must choose one door. Consider wisely, for your choice combined with theirs will determine the nature of the challenge each group faces ahead.`
   - `When compassion is met with compassion, challenges are more easily overcome for both parties. Many hands make for light work.`
   - `When self-preservation is met with self-preservation, challenges are made significantly more difficult. An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.`
   - `When self-preservation is met with compassion, the selfish walk through unscathed while the burden of both challenges is borne by the compassionate`
- Lavender Library
