# Derek's Dance Diary

Dear Diary, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My parents just don't understand! They insist I have to go to fighter's camp to learn how to wield a sword and shield and use archery and all these other combat things... Well I don't CARE about that stuff! Why can't they just accept me for who I am? 

Toodle-oo,
-Derek

Dear Diary,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the part! I'm going to be the lead in the school musical :) Who would have guessed that Hobblegate's Boarding School for Gnomes would have such a good drama program? My favorite part of the play is the song right before intermission. The coreography is hard, but I feel like I'm starting to get it. 

Signing off,
-Derek
 
Dear Diary,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today was a mixed bag. I tried to combine my dance moves with a few combat techniques I learned from my classmates. They just laughed when I called it “dance fighting.” One of them even said I’d be better off twirling in a tutu! I’ll show them! Tomorrow, I’ll perfect my “Spin and Slash” move. Who knew a pirouette could pack a punch?

Staying Fabulous,
-Derek

Dear Diary,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Big news! I’ve decided to host a demonstration of dance fighting in the glade. I invited everyone—maybe they’ll take me seriously if they see it in action! I practiced all day, but a squirrel stole my dance shoes! What are the odds? When I finally got them back they seemed different somehow... Anyways, fingers crossed for tomorrow!

Catch you on the flippity,
-Derek

Dear Diary,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, I had a breakthrough! I met with the school's dance coach, and she surprisingly loved my concept. We’re collaborating on a piece that incorporates story, movement, and—wait for it—combat! She even suggested adding music! Maybe I can turn this into a real thing. My classmates may have mocked me, but I’m on to something here. Watch out, world! 
(*There is some specific dance-fighting coreography sketched below*)

See ya next dance,

  Dear Diary,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That pesky squirrel stole my shoes again! Why in the world would a squirrel need pirouette shoes? It's okay though because I’ve started crafting my own dance fighting gear! I made a twirling ribbon that swishes when I move, and a whip which is equal parts fabulous and fearsome. It’s a sight to behold, and it makes me feel like a true dance warrior! I’ll host a workshop next week to teach others the art. If they laugh, at least I’ll look good doing it!

Until we twirl again,
-Derek

  Dear Diary,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today was my first official dance fighting workshop, and it was a hit! Gnomes from all over came to learn. They laughed at first, but then they got into it! We created a routine called “The Gnome Tango of Triumph.” I’ve never felt prouder. My classmates are starting to take me seriously. Maybe there’s hope for this dream of mine after all!

Keep dancing,
-Derek

  
  Dear Diary,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the workshop has been going so well, I've decided I want to start my own school. The problem at my old school was that dancing and fighting were always considered separate disciplines and there was no collaboration between the drama and combat departments. But I've proven that this is a mistake! So starting today, I'm going to make my own school: Derek's Dance Academy for Fighters.

With twirls and determination,
-Derek
